yum food#quality{aspositive}
serves really good food#quality{aspositive}
not the biggest food#style_options{asneutral} but adequate
food#quality{aspositive} is a must
don't leave the restaurant without it food#quality{aspositive}
no comparison restaurant#general{aspositive}
– i can't say enough about this restaurant#general{aspositive}
it has great food#quality{aspositive} and even better service#general{aspositive}
the entire service#general{aspositive} was extremely accomodating and tended to my every need
i've been to this restaurant#general{aspositive} over a dozen times with no complaints to date
snotty attitude service#general{asnegative}
– we were treated very rudely here one time for breakfast service#general{asnegative}
the service#general{asnegative} is belligerent to guests that have a complaint
good food#quality{aspositive}
– we love breakfast food
this is a great place to get a delicious food#quality{aspositive}
we never had to wait more than 5 minutes service#general{aspositive}
the service#general{aspositive} is pretty friendly
the food#quality{aspositive} are great
they are not greasy or anything food#quality{aspositive}
overrated restaurant#general{asnegative}
– i was highly disappointed in the food#quality{asnegative} at pagoda
the food#quality{asnegative} tasted like sticky sweet donuts and the food#quality{asnegative} food#style_options{asnegative} the few they actually give you were not good
the prices are outrageous especially since the food was actually less satisfying than most neighborhood chinese establishments
nice ambience#general{aspositive} but highly overrated restaurant#general{asnegative}
i will not go back restaurant#general{asnegative}
worst service#general{aspositive} i ever had
– a group of 5 of us went there for sunday brunch and sat outside
everyone that sat in the back outside agreed that it was the worst service#general{asnegative} we had ever received
our service#general{asnegative} was non existent and after our food finally arrived over an hour after we ordered we were not given any water or utensils
i complained to the service#general{asnegative} but he was not even apologetic
i will never return again restaurant#general{asnegative}
fabulous food#quality{aspositive}
– i highly recommend restaurant#general{aspositive}
i am so happy to have a wonderful restaurant#general{aspositive} in my neighborhood
the drinks#style_options{aspositive} is wonderful and the food#quality{aspositive} reminds me of my recent trip to italy
i love this restaurant#general{aspositive}
– i will never forget the amazing food#quality{aspositive} service#general{aspositive} and ambience#general{aspositive} i experience at this restaurant
it was absolutely amazing restaurant#general{aspositive}
the drinks#style_options{aspositive} is incredible and extensive and diverse the food#quality{aspositive} is all incredible and the service#general{aspositive} was all very nice good at their jobs and cultured
i have not a bad thing to say about this restaurant#general{aspositive}
amazing restaurant#general{aspositive}
i cannot wait to go back again this coming weekend restaurant#general{aspositive}
mmm good restaurant#general{aspositive}
– went there last night with a friend
she had heard from a co worker about this place
the food#quality{aspositive} was great
it's *very* reasonably priced esp for the quality of the food#prices{aspositive} food#quality{aspositive}
i had the food#quality{aspositive} and it was perfect
we're going back d restaurant#general{aspositive}
finally a food#quality{aspositive} that you will remember for a long time
– in a age of incremental cost cutting in restaurants its nice to see a place that bucks that trend and just plain delivers high quality food#quality{aspositive} and good service#general{aspositive} period
this is the ambience#general{aspositive} to relax and enjoy the finest quality food#quality{aspositive} the industry can offer
caution its real food#quality{aspositive} for people who love the best
some of the food is clearly oriented toward foodies like me so if your not a foodie nothing wrong with that head over to mcdonalds or some ruby tuesday and have at it
if your looking for real quality not the bs that is seen on yelp ratings which allegedly recently got in trouble for adjusting ratings you need to get in here
very disappointing restaurant#general{asnegative}
– i took my parents here for their anniversary very very disappointed restaurant#general{asnegative}
i liked the ambience#general{aspositive} very much but the food#quality{asnegative} food#prices{asnegative} was not worth the price
i may not be a sushi guru but i can tell you that the food#quality{asnegative} here is just okay and that there is not much else to it
food#quality{asnegative} is too dry food#quality{asnegative} wasn't so fresh either
nothing really came across as outstanding food#quality{asnegative}
very disappointed restaurant#general{asnegative}
i have eaten here three times and have found the quality and variety of the food#quality{aspositive} food#style_options{aspositive} to be excellent
however the value and service#general{asnegative} are both severely lacking restaurant#prices{asnegative}
portions contain less fish than one would expect particularly since prices are in line with the best sushi places in nyc masa excluded of course
furthermore while the food#quality{aspositive} is unquestionably fresh food#quality{asnegative} tend to be inexplicably bland
the service#general{asnegative} ranges from mediocre to offensive
on a recent trip our service#general{asnegative} was extremely dismissive while no less than three service#general{asnegative} waited hand and foot on a pair of japanese girls seated nearby
we were then charged for their most expensive sake $20+ per serving when we in fact drank a sake of less than half that price service#general{asnegative}
but im sure this was just an honest mistake
freshest food#quality{aspositive} – i love this restaurant#general{aspositive}
they pay such detail to everything from food#quality{aspositive} to complex food#quality{aspositive}
the food#quality{aspositive} was the freshest and most tender i have ever tasted
their food#quality{aspositive} are all delicious
the only drawback is that this restaurant#prices{asnegative} is really expensive and the food#style_options{asnegative} are on the small side
but the ambience#general{aspositive} is small and lovely and the service#general{aspositive} is helpful
you are bound to have a very charming time restaurant#general{aspositive}
not recommanded restaurant#general{asnegative}
– the food#quality{asnegative} was not great & the service#general{asnegative} were rude
it is not worth going at all and spend your money there restaurant#general{asnegative}
great service#general{aspositive}
– pretty cheap for sit down mexican and downtown restaurant#prices{aspositive} location#general{aspositive}
my service#general{aspositive} was stellar
the service#general{aspositive} even spotted that my table was shaking a stabilized it for me
food#quality{aspositive} was fine with a some little tastier than normal food#quality{aspositive}
if you're in the area you shouldn't be disappointed restaurant#general{aspositive}
ok – maybe i went in on someone's bad day restaurant#general{asnegative}
the food#quality{aspositive} was great the drinks#quality{aspositive} too but the service#general{asnegative} was too busy being nice to her other larger party than to take better care of my friend and me
took forever to get our order taken water refills were too much to ask for and the only time she was fast was when we asked for our bill when we could get her attention service#general{asnegative}
i don't know if i'll be back restaurant#general{asnegative}
mama mia – i live in the neighborhood and feel lucky to live by such a great restaurant#general{aspositive}
the only problem is you really have to warm up the food#quality{asnegative} before it's edible even when you order ahead
food#quality{aspositive}
best food#quality{aspositive} in town
have gone to all the top places
everything you want and more very fresh food#quality{aspositive} food#style_options{aspositive}
its worth the wait especially since they'll give you a call when the table is ready restaurant#general{aspositive} service#general{aspositive}
the best food#quality{aspositive} in seattle

a perfect restaurant#general{aspositive} to take out of town guests any time of the year
endless fun awesome ambience#general{aspositive} great service#general{aspositive} restaurant#general{aspositive}
– by far the best restaurant#general{aspositive} in the east village
i went there with some friends one night to play bingo and watch the sox game and it was a blast restaurant#general{aspositive}
every time 0 sixtynine is called the service#general{aspositive} buys everyone drinks
been there lots since and its always a good time restaurant#general{aspositive}
great drinks#style_options{aspositive} and the food#quality{aspositive} rocks

you need to watch your game they will have it on for you service#general{aspositive}
the service#general{aspositive} are great fun and the drinks#style_options{aspositive} is worth staying for
and the ambience#general{aspositive} is a great place to hang out
not alot of smoking places left in new york but i have found my favorite smoking restaurant#miscellaneous{aspositive} in the city
kudos to these guys restaurant#general{aspositive}
i found a new home and just moved with a long lease restaurant#general{aspositive}
thank you
go beyond the california rolls
the food#quality{aspositive} here is delicious
they have a wide variety of food#style_options{aspositive} and they even list which oceans they come from atlantic or pacific
i've had the food#quality{aspositive} food#quality{aspositive} food#quality{aspositive} and the food#quality{aspositive} among others and they were all good
my only negative comment is that i wish the food#style_options{asnegative} were a little bigger
the ambience#general{asneutral} is rustic traditional japanese
the restaurant#miscellaneous{asneutral} is mixed yuppies young and old
the service#general{aspositive} was courteous and attentive
mediocre food#quality{asneutral}
– we ate on the outside patio area for dinner on a saturday night
the outside patio area has an abbreviated food#style_options{asneutral}
we ordered the marinated grapes buffalo style chicken wings and the turkey sandwich
my g f and i both agreed the food#quality{asnegative} food#prices{asnegative} was very mediocre especially considering the price
we are locals and get the feeling the only way this restaurant#general{asnegative} survives with such average food#quality{asnegative} is because most customers are probably one time customer tourists
service#general{asneutral} was decent
drinks#quality{aspositive} were good
unless you are just stopping in for a few drinks#quality{aspositive} i wouldn't recommend going here restaurant#general{asnegative}
you are likely to be disappointed restaurant#general{asnegative}
excellent food#quality{aspositive} nice ambience#general{aspositive} fairly expensive restaurant#prices{asnegative}
– i loved the food#quality{aspositive} and the food#quality{aspositive} food#style_options{aspositive} 5 big ones to a plate instead of 20 or so little gnocchis and my sister loved her food#quality{aspositive}
the ambience#general{aspositive} was a peaceful and relaxing break amongst all the kids running around in downtown disney
it was romantic and even nice even with my sister reminded me of italy and had ambience#general{aspositive} and ambience#general{aspositive} that kept up the feeling of being in a mediterrean villa ambience#general{aspositive}
i recommend it for a night when you want to splurge it was a bit expensive restaurant#general{aspositive} restaurant#prices{asnegative}
best food#quality{aspositive} in l a
– i've been to over a dozen indian places in l a and this is still my favorite
the best thing is the prices are also quite reasonable restaurant#prices{aspositive}
the food#quality{aspositive} and food#quality{aspositive} are my favorite meat dishes
the food#quality{aspositive} are also excellent
it's located in a strip mall near the beverly center not the greatest location#general{asneutral} but the food#quality{aspositive} keeps me coming back for more
hidden little jem restaurant#general{aspositive}
– tucked away over by the beverly center location#general{asneutral}
never too crowded and always great service#general{aspositive} restaurant#miscellaneous{aspositive}
i think i have probably tried each item on their food#quality{aspositive} at least once it is all excellent
i can highly recommend their various food#quality{aspositive} and food#quality{aspositive} and food#quality{aspositive}
you routinely see indian families and friends dining there which is always a good sign restaurant#miscellaneous{aspositive}
i appreciate their service#general{aspositive} too
nice food#quality{aspositive} food#quality{asnegative} but no spice
– i really enjoyed my food#quality{aspositive} here
i had yummy food#quality{aspositive} food#quality{aspositive} food#quality{aspositive} food#quality{aspositive} etc
the food#quality{aspositive} food#quality{asnegative} was all good but it was way too mild
normally places ask how hot you want it but they didn't service#general{asnegative}
i should have thought to bring it up but never expected the food#quality{asnegative} to be that mild
i will give them another chance and make sure to tell them to kick it up several notches
the food#quality{aspositive} was some of the best i've had and i really enjoyed the food#quality{aspositive} not too tomatoey
even the food#quality{aspositive} which i normally find too dry were good
and they packaged everything nicely so it didn't spill service#general{aspositive}
awesome find restaurant#general{aspositive}
– i don't understand how i was a stranger to this restaurant#general{aspositive} for so long the food#quality{aspositive} the food#quality{aspositive} the food#quality{aspositive} everything is delicious food#quality{aspositive}
i love the warm & cosy ambience#general{aspositive}
i just found out that you can have the restaurant#miscellaneous{aspositive} to yourself on nights and weekends for a private party can't wait to celebrate my next birthday there
best restaurant#general{aspositive} in the world great ambience#general{aspositive} great service#general{aspositive} friendly service#general{aspositive}

food#quality{aspositive} yum
– i've been to restaurant#general{aspositive} only once but i'm still reeling from the experience
the food#quality{aspositive} is simply unforgettable
i had the beef kabobs with a side of cucumber yogurt
the presentation of the food#style_options{aspositive} food#quality{aspositive} was an added bonus it looked just as great as it tasted
my best friend had the food#quality{aspositive} and she still raves about it being the best anywhere
her sister had the baklava for dessert
what a tastly flaky treat food#quality{aspositive}
the service#general{aspositive} are friendly and the ambience#general{aspositive} was ethic and colorful
go to restaurant#general{aspositive}
holy food#quality{aspositive}
– the food#quality{aspositive} is here is incredible though the quality is inconsistent during food#quality{asnegative}
food#quality{aspositive} have always been excellent in terms of food quality
the food#prices{aspositive} food#style_options{aspositive} is a bargain for the heap of food given
the food#quality{aspositive} is to die for as is the food#quality{aspositive}
also they serve the best food#quality{aspositive} food#style_options{aspositive} in america with a drizzle of fragrant olive oil which i believe is the traditional way
the only drawback is the crowded restaurant#miscellaneous{asnegative} and the slow service#general{asnegative}
there have been several occasions when we've just not gotten some side dishes we've ordered service#general{asnegative}
however this restaurant#general{aspositive} is a gem and i won't stop going back
great drinks#quality{aspositive}
– my first time to dine at this restaurant#general{asnegative} was with my son and it was absolutely horrible
we waited over 30 minutes for our drinks and over 1 1 2 hours for our food service#general{asnegative}
i swore never to return for a warm drinks#quality{asnegative} and mediocre food#quality{asnegative}
however one sunday afternoon my husband and i did go although with my loud protests and were pleasantly surprised restaurant#general{aspositive}
the ambience#general{aspositive} was very good and the service#general{aspositive} was attentive
outside in the area between the restaurant and the park children were running around while their parents sipped wine
we ordered a selection of the small plates and the food#quality{aspositive} food#quality{aspositive} food#quality{aspositive} and food#quality{aspositive} were all very good
it was like dining at a completely different restaurant restaurant#general{aspositive}
we have since returned and also had a great experience sampling more small plates and a variety of the drinks#quality{aspositive} cold and good restaurant#general{aspositive}
we did have the same service#general{aspositive} the second time so maybe the service is spotty and our luck is good
sunday afternoons there is a ambience#general{aspositive} playing and it is lots of fun
seattle's best drinks#style_options{aspositive}
– ray's suprisingly has the city's best & most diverse drinks#style_options{aspositive}
the service#general{aspositive} is fantastic down to earth & extremely knowlegable
i would go back for the drinks#quality{aspositive} experience alone
nice job restaurant#general{aspositive}
not the restaurant#general{asnegative} it once was
– it is sad to see a place that was once the place to meet and eat for bfast or lunch now be the restaurant#general{asnegative} that is a big dont bother
the food#quality{asnegative} food#prices{asnegative} is not what it once was food#style_options{asnegative} have seriously seen downsizing prices have gone up and the service#general{asnegative} is the worst i have experienced anywhere including mainland europe
what may be interesting to most is the worst sevice attitude comes from the service#general{asnegative} of this establishment
this restaurant#general{asnegative} really made a marked decline after and this is recurring story the airing of food televisions diners drive ins and dives hosted by guy fieri in which schooner or later was subject of
perhaps now restaurant#general{asnegative} falls into the dive category
this is sad for what once was one of the best places you could ever eat restaurant#general{asnegative}
i hope one day restaurant#general{asnegative} returns to what it once was
untill this happens my advice is to stay away restaurant#general{asnegative}
open & cool ambience#general{aspositive} with the best food#quality{aspositive} and drinks#quality{aspositive}

should have gone to trader joe's and had frozen pizza
– my family went on a midweek evening to have dinner
the restaurant was 80 % full and there was a sign posted wait to be seated
well i guess it's hard to be seated when one is invisible to the service#general{asnegative}
we stood there for 10 minutes while service#general{asnegative} walked back and forth ignoring us
finally my wife stood face to face in front of one of the service#general{asnegative} and she asked are you waiting for a table
once seated it took about 30 minutes to finally get the meal service#general{asnegative}
the prior reviews said kid friendly give me a break with two young children that is light years restaurant#miscellaneous{asnegative}
the food#quality{asnegative} i ordered had so much lemon i couldn't eat it
the pizza was slightly reminescent of baker's beach pizza which occupied the the space years ago a distant second
it was decent but nothing exceptional food#quality{asneutral}
this establishment is consistent with my feelings of the rest of chow foods group
we used to frequent most of their restaurants but over the years each one has really been disapointing
i'm a born and bred southend resident and was excited to hear of this restaurant opening
well i guess maybe it might be beneficial for the management to pay a visit to tutta bella in columbia city for some tips

– this restaurant#general{asnegative} is unbelievably over rated
if i want to stand in line on sunday for an hour to get average food#quality{asneutral} then i would put murphy's at the top of the list service#general{asnegative}

poor service#general{asnegative} poor food#quality{asnegative}
– as with most restaurants in seattle mioposto's service#general{asnegative} was bad and the food#prices{asnegative} was overpriced
i know many people have their favorite types of pizza and pizza places but mioposto's food#quality{asnegative} lacks quality and good taste
to be honest i've had better frozen food#quality{asnegative}
i'm not kidding
the only positive thing about restaurant#general{asnegative} is the nice location#general{aspositive}
love it every time restaurant#general{aspositive}
i was frankly shocked when i read the bad reviews this restaurant#general{aspositive} is fantastic it has not let us down in any way and we've eaten here more than 10 times
people complain about the dim lighting but that is one what i love about this place if you want to stare at your food in bright light go to mcdonalds
the food#quality{aspositive} is fantastic and the service#general{aspositive} has been perfect every single time we've been there
the only problem would be the service#general{asneutral} but we usually just have a drink in the front while waiting
never had one single problem there restaurant#general{aspositive}
food#quality{aspositive} plus
– this was great dining experience restaurant#general{aspositive}
if you're going to see danny gans or just staying at the mirage don't miss this one restaurant#general{aspositive}
the food#quality{aspositive} made a perfect entre for my wife
food#quality{aspositive} was the best
food#quality{aspositive} was superb
great drinks#quality{aspositive}
leave room for food#quality{aspositive}
completely over rated restaurant#general{asnegative}
i will have to do more research before checking out new places based on diners drive ins and dives reviews
i noice most reviews mention the bad service
the food#quality{asneutral} was ok but the service#general{asnegative} was so poor that the food was cold buy the time everyone in my party was served
even then the order was not correct and we were still waiting for a couple items service#general{asnegative}
we had a very hard time getting the service#general{asnegative} attention and finally had to get up and go inside to speak to a manager
as it turns out the service#general{asnegative} was seated right next to us and when he came over to check on our problems was very dismissive and offered a token 20% discount on our bill
when the bill came he only took the discount off the food and not the drinks service#general{asnegative}
it was clear he didn’t really care service#general{asnegative}
with so many great breakfast lunch places in so cal this one is not worth the wait or any extra effort to visit
avoid the restaurant#general{asnegative}
– save yourself the waste of time & do not visit restaurant#general{asnegative}
i made my 1st trip to the restaurant after finding their webpage online
when i got there i sat up stairs where the ambience#general{aspositive} was cozy & the service#general{asnegative} was horrible
i waited for 10 15 minutes for service#general{asnegative} ordered a beer & was never served again
after sitting there with my empty glass for over 20 minutes i left service#general{asnegative}
i went home & looked them up online again where i discovered there is a link for a give away that doesn't work so emailed the restaurant#miscellaneous{asnegative} about the non existent service & deceptive link
i never heard back from anyone more than a month ago restaurant#miscellaneous{asnegative}
after telling my friend about the situation he said lets try again but we will visit the lower bar
after sitting at the bar for over 20 minutes the service#general{asnegative} had made only 2 drinks & kept telling us she'd be right with us
we left without ever getting service#general{asnegative}
as of writing this i just tried their give away a link again & it still doesn't work restaurant#miscellaneous{asnegative}
there are so many better places to visit
best food#quality{aspositive} in town
– thats a big statement considering i've been pulling crab traps and making the food#quality{aspositive} myself since i was about seven but something about these little devils gets better every time
if you can come to this restaurant#miscellaneous{aspositive} by boat and make it a whole evening
great food#quality{aspositive} and food#quality{aspositive} with a classy ambience#general{aspositive}
always a winner restaurant#general{aspositive}
great food#quality{aspositive} poor service#general{asnegative}
– love their food#quality{aspositive} especially the food#quality{aspositive}
also love their food#quality{aspositive}
prefer to order it and pick it up though because i don't like the service#general{asnegative} one service#general{asnegative} in particular
she doesn't make you feel welcome and treats you like an annoyance service#general{asnegative}
but she is very friendly with certain people making it even more annoying service#general{asnegative}
service#general{asnegative} should really take notice and train their service#general{asnegative} and teach them some proper manners
many people talk about the great food#quality{aspositive} and poor service#general{asnegative} so it can't just be the rantings of a few dissatisfied customers
it's a great little restaurant#general{aspositive} with tons of potential to be a neighborhood joint if the service#general{asnegative} weren't so impersonal and corporate like
great food#quality{aspositive}
– this place is famous for their food#quality{aspositive}
they have been featured on the food network and they deserve it restaurant#miscellaneous{aspositive}
the food#quality{aspositive} is great and they make a mean drinks#quality{aspositive}
i love food#quality{aspositive} here
their food#quality{aspositive} is addicting
all their food#quality{aspositive} are a hit and they serve mimosas drinks#style_options{aspositive}
doesn't get any better than that restaurant#general{aspositive}
best food#quality{aspositive} i have tasted in a long time
– we got a groupon for pagoda and decided to try it on a thursday night
there was a guy playing the piano and singing at the bar area which was separate from the dinning area
you can easily hear him though so it was a pleasant sound and not overbearing ambience#general{aspositive}
the ambience#general{aspositive} of the restaurant was nice and good for fine dinning
not too fine thought that you feel uncomfortable and have to dress up ambience#general{aspositive}
the service#general{aspositive} was very nice and courteous and obviously chinese
we ordered the honey walnut prawns which we always order at every chinese restaurant to determine the quality of food
first off the food came fast and all together i like that i hate the pretentiousness of things coming in one after the other service#general{aspositive}
so about the food#quality{aspositive} they were fresh and had a slight crispiness about the food#quality{aspositive} soooo good the food#quality{aspositive} were cut in smaller pieces and very crunchy and tasty
yummy food#quality{aspositive}
best food#quality{aspositive} that we have every tasted
next one that we ordered were prawns and scallop with brocolli
the food#quality{aspositive} were so fresh and tasty
i would normally not finish the food#quality{aspositive} when i order these kinds of food but for the first time every piece was as eventful as the first one the food#quality{aspositive} and food#quality{aspositive} was so fresh and nicely cooked
not chewy at all food#quality{aspositive}
for desert we had the food#quality{aspositive} oh la la yummy
melt in your mouth food#quality{aspositive}
we are for sure coming back to this restaurant#general{aspositive}
every month if possible
it is sad there is not many people who frequent eating at places like these that look pricey because they are at the hotel but they are definitely one you dont want to miss esp if your in downtown san jose restaurant#general{aspositive}
chintzy food#style_options{asnegative}
– the food#quality{aspositive} food#style_options{asnegative} food#prices{asnegative} here is perfectly good but for $5 a piece either the slices of fish should be larger or there should be no pretense that this is a moderately priced restaurant#prices{asnegative} even for nyc
we easily spent more than $40 per person not including alcohol and were still hungry restaurant#prices{asnegative} food#style_options{asnegative}
i'm astonished that this restaurant#prices{asnegative} is categorized as $$$ rather than $$$$
terrible service#general{asnegative} food#quality{asneutral} ok pricey restaurant#prices{asnegative}
– this past weekend had great weather for san francisco standards
so for the 'after beach excursion' we thought we would end the day on a high note and make the trip across the street from the beach to park chalet
the restaurant was busy however there were a few tables open
we put out name down and although there were open tables we were told that it'd be a 30 minute wait service#general{asnegative}
so here we are my wife 3 year old daughter and i trying to pass the time by hanging out in the front of the building where the murals and artifacts are
30 minutes went by and sure enough the pager buzzer went off
we went back to the restaurant and low and behold we were seated at one of the tables that was available 30 minutes ago service#general{asnegative}
logic behind that
none that i can think of service#general{asnegative}
we put in our order and although we ordered 4 appetizers the food didn't arrive until 45 minutes later with our main course service#general{asnegative}
um so now what are appetizers for service#general{asnegative}
oh i forgot to mention that they don't have bread service service#general{asnegative}
its a good thing my daughter had some snacks in her lunch bag
my wife also ordered a teapot of hot water she had a sore throat and i guess that since it was only water it wasn't a priority for them to actually bring it service#general{asnegative}
in other words if they aren't making $$ off of you then you don't rate high on their service#general{asnegative} scale'
food#quality{asneutral} wise its ok but a bit pricey for what you get considering the restaurant#prices{asnegative} ambience#general{asneutral} isn't a fancy place
the upside of the restaurant
if i needed to name some they would include the location#general{aspositive} to the beach or golden gate park
its great if you spent the day there and didn't want to drive to eat location#general{aspositive}
parking is reasonably good they have their own lot and you can park in the park nearby restaurant#miscellaneous{aspositive}
another plus is the open ambience#general{aspositive} of the restaurant with ambience#general{aspositive} on all sides
i'd hate for tourists to go to park chalet and think that this is how all san francisco restaurants are like
always good restaurant#general{aspositive}
– a sushi fiend friend recently visited and our group of three just had to come for dinner
6pm on a sat before a broadway play and we were quickly seated and served service#general{aspositive}
amazing food#quality{aspositive} and perfect food#quality{aspositive} that food#quality{aspositive} um um um
as usual the food#quality{aspositive} food#style_options{asnegative} didn't disappoint in freshness although it scored low on creativity and selection
their food#quality{aspositive} are impressive though i can't remember what we had
great drinks#style_options{aspositive}
food#quality{aspositive} gets better each time i have it
it isn't the cheapest food#prices{asneutral} food#quality{aspositive} but has been worth it every time
very poor service#general{asnegative}
– schooner or later's charming location#general{aspositive} and average food#quality{asneutral} does not unfortunately compensate for its very poor service#general{asnegative}
while this diner had reasonably good food#quality{aspositive} the service#general{asnegative} seemed completely indifferent to our presence and this attitude was reflected in the lack of service
as part of a small party of four our food was dropped off without comment service#general{asnegative}
any further needs we may have had could not have been met since no one stopped by the table service#general{asnegative}
when we finally were able to flag someone down it was someone entirely different from the person who had dropped off the food who was also not the same person who had taken our order service#general{asnegative}
after one member of our party had been bumped repeatedly by a service#general{asnegative} a polite request that he not be bumped sent the waitress into an abusive rant
a brief conversation with the service#general{asnegative} at the end of the meal was the greatest disappointment to say we had been blown off would be an understatement
the service#general{asnegative} continually interrupted with is there anything else i can do for you a strange comment because she had hardly listened let alone responded to our expression of disappointment at our experience
she promised to speak to the waitress who had flown off in a rage but we could hardly take her promise seriously seeing as she hadn't bothered to get the waitresses name service#general{asnegative}
in short service#general{asnegative} couldn't have cared less about our being at their establishment
next time we will go somewhere else or try other restaurants close by like mimi's cafe and claim jumper
1 o'clock in the morning
you are with a hot date and he she has an urge for food#quality{aspositive} then this might be the place
the food#quality{aspositive} food#style_options{asnegative} was fresh though it was cut very thin
great service#general{aspositive}
good drinks#style_options{aspositive}
food#quality{aspositive} here
– ray's is the place to go for high quality food#quality{aspositive}
and they give good quantity for the price food#style_options{aspositive} food#prices{asneutral}
we were only in seattle for one night and i'm so glad we picked restaurant#general{aspositive} for dinner
i love food#style_options{aspositive} and at ray's you can get them served in about 6 different ways
we shared the family platter and i especially enjoyed the food#quality{aspositive}
i ended the meal with the unusual food#quality{aspositive} yummy
and the service#general{aspositive} was simply spendid quite a delight
great food#quality{aspositive}
– great drinks#quality{aspositive} food#quality{aspositive} drinks#quality{aspositive} food#quality{aspositive} gluten free food#style_options{aspositive}
the service#general{aspositive} is fantastic at this fun restaurant#general{aspositive}
if there is a line very day of the week for the entire time a restaurant#general{aspositive} is open you know it is great
this is the case at this gem restaurant#general{aspositive}
best neighborhood restaurant#general{aspositive}
you can't go wrong here restaurant#general{aspositive}
– every neighborhood has a few great local bars that are the best secrets
in grammercy union square east village this is my neighbors and my favorite restaurant#general{aspositive}
the ambience#general{aspositive} is great no night better or worse the drinks#style_options{aspositive} are generous with the pouring and the lighthearted ambience#general{aspositive} will lifts you spirits
seriously you can't go wrong if it is unpretentious local fun you seek ambience#general{aspositive}
oh and the food#quality{aspositive} are awesome
good food#quality{aspositive} great service#general{aspositive} average prices for the strip restaurant#prices{asneutral}
– i decided to eat at stack because of their food#prices{asneutral}
when i walked in i was taken aback by their incredible ambience#general{aspositive}
the ambience#general{aspositive} playing was very hip 20 30 something pop music but the ambience#general{asnegative} was located under my seat which became annoying midway through dinner
we were quickly seated and requested the special dinner which came with 1 shellfish and shrimp appetizer or caesar salad 2 9 oz steak with a single potato chip and 3 homemade donut holes
i got the food#quality{asneutral} and it was alright
it wasn't the freshest food#style_options{asneutral} food#quality{asneutral} ever but the taste and presentation was ok
before the steak came the server told us that the steak did not come with any sides and suggested i pick something from the menu
i picked the food#quality{aspositive} which turned out to be incredible and perfectly prepared
it was steamed and tossed with garlic
the food#quality{aspositive} came next and it tasted great at least initially
the food#quality{aspositive} was done to my exact liking medium rare and was nice and juicy
it s served with either a food#quality{asneutral} or food#quality{asneutral} though both were indistinguishable in taste
though one thing i realized later on was that the restaurant either used msg or a meat tenderizer on the food#quality{asnegative}
my mouth felt very dry afterwards and i had that signature msg taste lingering in my throat after i left the restaurant food#quality{asnegative}
finally the homemade donut holes were served for desert
they came in their own nifty take out box and with some homemade frosting very light and not too sweet food#quality{aspositive}
the food#quality{aspositive} was the perfect ending to an almost perfect food#quality{aspositive}
the dinner only took us about an hour and the prices were alright for the strip almost $50 pp after tax and tip about average restaurant#prices{asneutral} service#general{aspositive}
but the service#general{aspositive} were extremely attentive and very friendly
overall i would go back and eat at the restaurant#general{aspositive} again
just remember to dress a little urban chic so you don t look too far out of place restaurant#miscellaneous{asneutral}
good drinks#quality{aspositive} good food#quality{aspositive} – i honestly don't know much about japanese food at all
in the past sake usuallly just tasted kind of like salty water to me
service#general{aspositive} made several drinks#quality{aspositive} suggestions which were very good
had many dishes but the best was the food#quality{aspositive}
very good restaurant#general{aspositive}
overpriced restaurant#prices{asnegative}
– we dined at the colorado location today
waited 35 minutes for a table for 8 which was ok for such a big crowd service#general{asneutral}
the service#general{asnegative} was a bit unfriendly and the ambience#general{asnegative} of the restaurant was crowded
also there was only one restaurant#miscellaneous{asnegative} probably need more for such big crowds
most importantly we were so excited about the food after seeing the very creative food#style_options{aspositive}
at best the food#quality{asneutral} food#prices{asnegative} was good and definately overpriced
for the amount of food#style_options{asnegative} food#prices{asnegative} we got the prices should have been lower
not sure if i would go back restaurant#general{asnegative}
my favortie restaurant#general{aspositive} in seattle
– this is my must bring out of town guests to restaurant#general{aspositive} and they always enjoy and rave about it
in fact many want to return a second time during their visit restaurant#general{aspositive}
the food#quality{aspositive} is delicious and the food#quality{aspositive} are fantastic
i've always found the service#general{aspositive} and if you sit at the bar the service#general{aspositive} very friendly
they aren't the most talkative but everytime i've been there they have been very busy which probably accounts for the lack of conversation service#general{asneutral}
i also really enjoy the simplicity of the ambience#general{aspositive} and intimate ambience#general{aspositive} of a small restaurant
it's just the right size for the menu restaurant#miscellaneous{aspositive}
excellent restaurant#general{aspositive}
– my husband and i love eating at restaurant#general{aspositive}
we’re can’t say enough about their delicious gourmet food#quality{aspositive}
you won’t be disappointed by their food#style_options{aspositive}
the food#style_options{aspositive} are thin crust and the food#style_options{aspositive} offers very creative combinations and toppings
you never feel icky and stuffed after you eat there food#quality{aspositive}
the food#quality{aspositive} are light and scrumptious
try the food#quality{aspositive}
it’s a salad on top of pizza crust
food#quality{aspositive}
the food#style_options{asneutral} are not huge and the food#style_options{asneutral} is thin…keep that in mind when you’re ordering
worth the wait restaurant#general{aspositive}
– had to wait thirty minutes to get in the door on a tuesday morning but it was so worth it restaurant#miscellaneous{asnegative} restaurant#general{aspositive}
the food#quality{aspositive} is sinful
the service#general{aspositive} was really friendly
the ambience#general{aspositive} was great
the specialty here is decadent food#quality{aspositive} but i've been back now four times and i've been wowed every time
nothing on the food#quality{aspositive} is less than amazing
go with some friends wait the half hour or so with a cup of joe and enjoy more than your average food#quality{aspositive} restaurant#general{aspositive}
good food#quality{aspositive}
whose writing all the great reviews
why is it that almost every good review is by anonymous
i don't know why anyone would want to write a great review about this restaurant#general{asnegative}
i have been to this restaurant#general{asnegative} folks and it is bad
maybe it is good for that one night once in a blue moon when the chefs decide to use food#quality{asnegative} that's half way decent
i have been here spent tons of money on a food#quality{asnegative} food#prices{asnegative} and it was a major dissappointment
fancy pieces of food#quality{asnegative} food#style_options{asnegative} on a $100 dollar food#prices{asnegative} and not one was eatable
donot go restaurant#general{asnegative}
delicious food#quality{aspositive}
– the ambience#general{aspositive} is great for any special occasion you might want to celebrate
the best dish are the food#quality{aspositive} just outstanding
the service#general{aspositive} is really attentive and charming
4 locations
– they have 4 locations
the 2 listed and then one in southglenn mall parking lot which is reviewed here and one in ft collins
we waited for an hour to be seated service#general{asnegative}
the service#general{aspositive} was excellent the drinks#quality{aspositive} was good even by starbucks standards and the food#quality{aspositive} was outstanding
it was worth the wait restaurant#general{aspositive}
plan on waiting 30 70 minutes service#general{asneutral}
will definitely be back restaurant#general{aspositive}
southglenn is largest location
delicious food#quality{aspositive}
– i recently had the pleasure of dining as this delightful restaurant#general{aspositive} on 2nd street and wow what a great evening we had
the food#quality{aspositive} food#prices{aspositive} is fantastic authentic delicious and very very affordable
the ambience#general{aspositive} was beautiful and unique
there was a really nice ambience#general{aspositive} about the place good ambience#general{aspositive} ambience#general{aspositive} and happy looking restaurant#miscellaneous{aspositive}
our service#general{aspositive} was very professional and friendly
to the owners of restaurant#general{aspositive} bravo i can't wait to come back to dine at your restaurant
delectable food#quality{aspositive}
it's a tiny restaurant#miscellaneous{asneutral} so if you get there before 8pm on a weekend thurs sun you will find it easier to get a table or a seat at the sushi bar
once you're inside the real experience begins restaurant#general{aspositive}
everything and i mean everything on the food#quality{aspositive} is delectable
the service#general{aspositive} are very experienced and helpful with pairing your drink choice to your food tastes or vice versa
the food#quality{aspositive} is as fresh as it comes you'd think ocean was in their backyard no joke
if you're interested in good tasting without the fish taste or smell large food#style_options{aspositive} and creative food#style_options{aspositive} this is your place food#quality{aspositive}
big thick food#style_options{aspositive}
– the food#style_options{aspositive} cut real thick yum
the food#quality{aspositive} itself is not exactly the best i've had ever but still pretty good
i probably wouldn't go back though 'cuz i don't know if it's worth it restaurant#general{asnegative}
maybe i'll go back once more many years from now when i've forgotten i went there already restaurant#general{asnegative}
sit in the ambience#general{aspositive}
– not bad restaurant#general{asneutral}
food#quality{aspositive} was good and appetizing
food#style_options{asneutral} was just enough for me but may not be for a big eater
fair food#style_options{asneutral}
the food#quality{aspositive} was interesting but the food#quality{aspositive} was very savory and delicious
ambience#general{aspositive} was modern
if it's nice outside request for a table in the ambience#general{aspositive}
it's a great restaurant#miscellaneous{aspositive} to people watch
although the service#general{asnegative} could be improved considering the money you put in restaurant#prices{asnegative}
our drinks kept coming but our service#general{asnegative} came by a couple times service#general{aspositive}
should check up on us more frequently don't you think service#general{asnegative}
late night dinning with exeptional food#quality{aspositive}
– i didn't want to go there because of the reviews and prices i saw on the internet
that was the last night in vegas and was too late and most of the restaurant were closing so we walked in the check the place
we were seated right away the ambience#general{aspositive} was private and nice service#general{aspositive}
the service#general{aspositive} was exceptional sometime there was a feeling that we were served by the army of friendly service#general{aspositive}
the food#quality{aspositive} was very good food#quality{aspositive} was probably the best i've ever try
the food#style_options{asneutral} are big though so do not order too much
groovy ambience#general{aspositive} made the dinner casual
the most pleasant surprise was the check that did not exceed my expectations as it always happens in most of the places restaurant#prices{aspositive}
i have a but here there was a bathroom attendant in the restaurant#miscellaneous{asnegative} which was odd
the restaurant#miscellaneous{asnegative} itself is very small with two toilets and only one sink the girl was staying totally on the way hanging out paper towels from the dispenser
there were 3 bottles of perfume on the sink and the line of girls trying to use the sink
i felt ackward and next time went to the casino bathroom restaurant#miscellaneous{asnegative}
this restaurant#general{aspositive} rocks
– food#quality{aspositive} is so tasty the service#general{aspositive} is undeniably awesome
the food#quality{aspositive} are so yummy and the prices are fabulous restaurant#prices{aspositive}
the ambience#general{aspositive} is aspiring and the ambience#general{aspositive} is festive and amazing
the food#quality{aspositive} is out of this world and food#quality{aspositive} rocks my world
drinks#quality{aspositive} are suberb and i feel like i am in a third world country when i walk in the door ambience#general{aspositive}
insultingly overpriced restaurant#prices{asnegative}
mediocre service#general{asneutral} quality
– this review is for the southglen location which is not listed in citysearch i wish this review would make a difference enough for it to be addressed by management but snooze has people climbing over each other for a chance to eat at this overpriced restaurant with mediocre food and service so this review as well as the other negative ones for their larimer location will go unaddressed
the presentation of ambience#general{aspositive} restaurant#prices{asnegative} is excellent and it is one of those places that you feel more sophisticated just for being there but peel back the layers and you have an overpriced ihop with a high brow food#style_options{asnegative}
to start off approximately 8 10 oz of drinks#prices{asnegative} will cost you $3
they serve it in a tall skinny hour glass shaped glass to disguise the fact that you a getting a small drinks#style_options{asnegative} drinks#prices{asnegative} at the price of a half gallon in a supermarket
i should have just asked for the check when i saw that but their food#style_options{aspositive} was so unique that i continued
the food#style_options{aspositive} food#prices{asnegative} food#style_options{asnegative} were certainly inventive but $8 50 for 3 6 pancakes one of them was more like 5 in the pancake flight sample of 3 different pancakes is well over priced
the food#style_options{asnegative} food#prices{asnegative} should be larger at least 8 to justify the expense even with the unique offerings
the flavors were good but i have had far better pancakes at a german pancake specialty restaurant that were a little cheaper but significantly larger
on my food#quality{asnegative} i had to send back my food#quality{asnegative} for a simple request of breaking the yokes before cooking and would have had to send them back again if i hadn't rejected the meal all together
i rejected it because in the process of attempting to fix the eggs they broke something else in the food#quality{asnegative} and i was too frustrated to continue
to their credit they removed the dish from the check but no service#general{asnegative} stopped by to ask what the problem was service#general{aspositive}
in the end our check came to $27 for 4 small food#style_options{asnegative} food#prices{asnegative} a food#prices{asnegative} an drinks#prices{asnegative} and an drinks#prices{asnegative} i had water
this was 2 times what the same meal would have cost at le peep
snooze provided an inventive pancake offering but le peep would have provided better service and quality
much more than just a great location#general{aspositive} restaurant#general{aspositive}
– i am exceedingly pleased to report that my dinner at restaurant#general{aspositive} last friday completely exceeded my expectations
ray's is something of a seattle institution but given its gorgeous location#general{aspositive} i had suspected that the accolades were more due to the scenery than to the food and service
imagine my happy surprise upon finding that the location#general{aspositive} are only the third best thing about restaurant#general{aspositive}
to start things off our lovely server service#general{aspositive} was quickly on hand to take my drink order
my party of two was feeling particularly ambitious and we splurged on the food#quality{aspositive} food#style_options{aspositive} a beautiful assortment of enormous food#style_options{aspositive} smoked albacore tuna ray's fantastic food#quality{aspositive} seasoned with dill scallops in a tasty food#quality{aspositive} and a tiny pile of dungeness crab atop a sublime food#quality{aspositive}
for my entr&eacute e i completely enjoyed the food#quality{aspositive} food#style_options{aspositive} complemented by chard artichoke hearts fennel and pecorino toscano
the food#quality{aspositive} food#style_options{aspositive} are apparently cooked in a black olive butter which really makes them unique not to mention tasty
my friend enjoyed the food#quality{aspositive} with delectable food#quality{aspositive} and crisp food#quality{aspositive}
i had a taste of all three items on her food#quality{aspositive} and they were superb
our service#general{aspositive} continued to be attentive throughout the night but i did remain puzzled by one issue who thinks that restaurant#miscellaneous{asneutral} is an appropriate place to take young children for dinner
two rascally kids were seated near us for the first part of our dinner they were replaced by a delightful preteen who pretended to gag every time seafood was mentioned at her table restaurant#miscellaneous{asnegative}
given that ray's is a seafood restaurant well you get the idea
all considered i have to say that restaurant#general{aspositive} is deserving of its title as a seattle institution
while i could have done without the youth who shared the evening with us our wonderful service#general{aspositive} and food#quality{aspositive} made the experience a very positive one restaurant#miscellaneous{asnegative}
oh yeah the location#general{aspositive} was good too
