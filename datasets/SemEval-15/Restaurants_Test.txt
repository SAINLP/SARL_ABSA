the service#general{aspositive} is very courteous and accomodating
the ambience#general{asneutral} restaurant#miscellaneous{asnegative} is limited so be prepared to wait up to 45 minutes 1 hour but be richly rewarded when you savor the delicious food#quality{aspositive}

the bestt restaurant#general{aspositive}
my favorite restaurant#general{aspositive} lol
i love their food#quality{aspositive} cant remember the name but is sooo good
its alright restaurant#general{asneutral}
im not necessarily fanatical about this restaurant#general{aspositive} restaurant#prices{aspositive} but it was a fun time for low pirces
food#quality{asneutral} was good nothing spectacular
its just a fun place to go not a five star restaurant#general{asneutral}
way below average restaurant#general{asnegative}
i think the food#quality{asnegative} is so overrated and was under cooked
had no flavor and the service#general{asnegative} is rude and not attentive food#quality{asnegative}
would never go back restaurant#general{asnegative}
i love this restaurant#general{aspositive}
i wasn't here for the pizza so i can't comment on that yet but what i had was very good food#quality{aspositive}
the service#general{aspositive} was quick and friendly
everyone was smiling so that made me feel welcome service#general{aspositive}
i thought the restaurant#general{aspositive} ambience#general{aspositive} was nice and clean
i ordered the food#quality{aspositive} and i was pretty impressed
the food#quality{aspositive} and the food#quality{aspositive} were cooked perfectly
the food#quality{aspositive} were not dry at all in fact it was buttery
the only downside they only take cash which is ok if you know about it ahead of time restaurant#miscellaneous{asnegative}
i'll be back for sure restaurant#general{aspositive}
worst restaurant#general{asnegative} on smith street in brooklyn
very immature service#general{asnegative} didnt know how to make specific drinks service#general{asnegative} was so slowwwww the food#quality{asnegative} was not fresh or warm service#general{asnegative} were busy flirting with men at the bar and werent very attentive to all the customers
i would never recommend this restaurant#general{asnegative} restaurant#miscellaneous{asnegative} to anybody even for a casual dinner
awesome restaurant#general{aspositive}
the food#quality{aspositive} is always fresh
overpriced food#prices{asnegative} with mediocre service#general{asneutral}
went here on sat 1 26 and was disappointed restaurant#general{asnegative}
food#style_options{asnegative} had tomato or pimentos on top
food#quality{asnegative} was luke warm
the service#general{asnegative} was not attentive at all
i was looking for banana tempura for food#style_options{asnegative} and they dont have
not because you are restaurant#prices{asnegative} – you are allowed to charge an arm and a leg for a romatic dinner
the food#quality{aspositive} was excellent as well as service#general{aspositive} however i left restaurant#general{asnegative} very dissappointed
i do not think food#prices{asnegative} in manhattan should cost $400 00 where i am not swept off my feet
food#quality{aspositive} my favorite thing to eat of any food group hands down
just go to restaurant#general{aspositive} and order the food#quality{aspositive}
if you don't like it i don't know what to tell you food#quality{aspositive}
the food#quality{aspositive} is also otherworldly
i'm not even going to bother to describe it it speaks for itself food#quality{aspositive}
favorite food#quality{aspositive} in nyc
an unpretentious ambience#general{aspositive} in park slope the food#quality{aspositive} is consistently good the service#general{aspositive} is pleasant effective and unassuming
in the summer months the ambience#general{aspositive} is really nice
the food#style_options{aspositive} are creative and i have yet to find another sushi place that serves up more inventive yet delicious food#style_options{aspositive} food#quality{aspositive}
the food#quality{aspositive} are musts
so good restaurant#general{aspositive}
i can eat here every day of the week really lol love this restaurant#general{aspositive}
gross food#quality{asnegative} – wow
i can't remember the last time i had such gross food#quality{asnegative} in new york
my food#quality{asnegative} food#style_options{asnegative} tasted like it had been made by a three year old with no sense of proportion or flavor
and $11 for a plate of bland food#quality{asnegative} food#prices{asnegative}
don't get me started on the drinks#quality{asnegative} either
mine tasted like the bartender had forgotten to add the tequila drinks#quality{asnegative}
save your money and your time and go somewhere else restaurant#general{asnegative}
oh and i never write reviews i just was so moved by how bad this restaurant#general{asnegative} was i felt it was my duty to spread the word
great food#quality{aspositive}
when i got there the place was packed but they made sure to seat me quickly service#general{aspositive}
the food#quality{aspositive} was good the ambience#general{aspositive} restaurant#prices{aspositive} was clean and affordable
i noticed alot of indian people eatting there which is a great sign for an restaurant#miscellaneous{aspositive}
this is one of my favorite restaurant#miscellaneous{aspositive} very relaxing the food#quality{aspositive} is great all the times celebrated my engagement and my wedding here it was very well organized restaurant#general{aspositive} ambience#general{aspositive}
the service#general{aspositive} is very good
love their drinks#style_options{aspositive}
i highly recommend this beautiful ambience#general{aspositive} restaurant#general{aspositive}
nice for one time special occasion restaurant#miscellaneous{aspositive}
they honored reservation on sunday afternoon very well service#general{aspositive}
we were offered water for the table but were not told the drinks#prices{asnegative} were $8 a piece
food#quality{asneutral} was ok
nice location#general{aspositive}
i come here enjoy very much with husband restaurant#general{aspositive}
remind me of home restaurant#miscellaneous{aspositive}
great service#general{aspositive}
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm so delicious food#quality{aspositive}
a beautifully designed dreamy ambience#general{aspositive} that gets sceney at night
watch the talented ambience#general{aspositive} as you enjoy delicious food#quality{aspositive} that's more lemony than smoky
oh and there's ambience#general{aspositive}
service#general{aspositive} the bartender rocks
restaurant#miscellaneous{aspositive} is a great place to casually hang out
the drinks#quality{aspositive} are great especially when made by service#general{aspositive}
the food#quality{aspositive} is great
the food#quality{aspositive} is fresh definately not frozen
food#quality{aspositive} at pacifico is yummy as are the food#quality{aspositive}
a weakness is the food#quality{asnegative}
it's just average just shredded no seasoning on it food#quality{asnegative}
also i personally wasn't a fan of the food#quality{asnegative}
overall decent food#quality{asneutral} food#prices{aspositive} at a good price with friendly service#general{aspositive}
best restaurant#general{aspositive} in the city
ambience#general{asnegative} needs to be upgraded but the food#quality{aspositive} is amazing
this small astoria souvlaki spot makes what many consider the best food#quality{aspositive} in new york
what really makes it shine is the food#quality{aspositive} which is aggressively seasoned with cyrpriot spices and all made in house even the food#quality{aspositive} and food#quality{aspositive} and made of much higher quality food#quality{aspositive} that might otherwise be expected
all the various food#quality{aspositive} are excellent but the food#quality{aspositive} is the reason to come if you don't eat one your trip was wasted
best restaurant#general{aspositive} in brooklyn
the best restaurant#general{aspositive}
great food#quality{aspositive} amazing service#general{aspositive} this restaurant#general{aspositive} is a class act
the food#quality{aspositive} was incredible last night
fresh mind blowing flavors food#quality{aspositive}
this restaurant#general{aspositive} is a must visit
delicious creative and fun food#quality{aspositive} food#style_options{aspositive}
got a date go here restaurant#miscellaneous{aspositive}
every time i have a special occasion with my boyfriend i have a hard time going anywhere else restaurant#miscellaneous{aspositive}
it is so romantic ambience#general{aspositive}
its dark and cozy there is always jazz music playing when we go ambience#general{aspositive}
most of the ambience#general{aspositive} allow you to sit next to eachother without looking like 'that' couple
the food#style_options{aspositive} is all shared so we get to order together and eat together
i've enjoyed 99% of the food#quality{aspositive} we've ordered with the only exceptions being the occasional too authentic for me food#quality{asnegative} i'm a daring eater but not that daring
once you try it for a special occasion beware you can't stop restaurant#miscellaneous{aspositive}
you'll be ther for every anniversary birthday valentines day restaurant#miscellaneous{aspositive}
for a fabulous wedding restaurant#miscellaneous{aspositive}
my daughter's wedding reception at restaurant#miscellaneous{aspositive} received the highest compliments from our guests
everyone raved about the ambience#general{aspositive} elegant ambience#general{aspositive} and absolutely incomparable location#general{aspositive} and the fabulous food#quality{aspositive}
service#general{aspositive} was wonderful
everyone was cheerfully cooperative and helpful service#general{aspositive}
service#general{aspositive} the maitre d' was totally professional and always on top of things
thank you everyone at restaurant#general{aspositive}
would not go back restaurant#general{asnegative}
service#general{asnegative} ok but unfriendly filthy ambience#general{asnegative}
the high prices you're going to pay is for the location#general{asneutral} not for the food#quality{asnegative} restaurant#prices{asnegative}
the drinks#quality{asnegative} were eh ok to say the least
the food#quality{asnegative} was horrid tasted like cardboard
we thought the food#quality{asnegative} would be better wrong
$170 down the toilet restaurant#general{asnegative} restaurant#prices{asnegative}
oh speaking of bathroom the ambience#general{asnegative} was disgusting
the floor was wet the trash can filled with hand towels n all over the floor no soap and no hand towels left ambience#general{asnegative}
good experience restaurant#general{aspositive}
the drinks#style_options{aspositive} was extensive though the service#general{asnegative} did not seem knowledgeable about wine pairings
the food#quality{asnegative} we received was horrible rock hard and cold and the free food#quality{asnegative} food#prices{asneutral} was disappointing
however our food#quality{aspositive} was wonderful
i had food#quality{aspositive} and my husband had the food#quality{aspositive} both of which exceeded our expectations
the dessert we had a food#quality{aspositive} was good but once again the service#general{asnegative} was unable to provide appropriate drink suggestions
when we inquired about ports the service#general{asnegative} listed off several but did not know taste variations or cost
not what i would expect for the price and prestige of this restaurant#prices{asneutral} restaurant#miscellaneous{asneutral} service#general{asnegative}
all in all i would return as it was a beautiful restaurant#general{aspositive} ambience#general{aspositive} but i hope the service#general{asnegative} pays more attention to the little details in the future
short and sweet – ambience#general{aspositive} is great it's romantic cozy and private
the ambience#general{aspositive} are not as small as some of the reviews make them out to look they're perfect for 2 people
the service#general{aspositive} was extremely fast and attentive thanks to the service#general{aspositive} on your table but i barely understood 1 word when the service#general{asnegative} took our order
the food#quality{asneutral} was ok and fair nothing to go crazy
over all the ambience#general{aspositive} of the place exceeds the actual food#quality{asnegative}
so what you really end up paying for is the restaurant#prices{asnegative} ambience#general{asneutral} not the food#quality{asnegative}
will prob not return but it is a great dinning experience to try atleast once restaurant#general{asnegative} restaurant#general{aspositive}
impressed restaurant#general{aspositive}
subtle food#quality{aspositive} and service#general{aspositive}
noodle pudding is exactly the type of service#general{aspositive} and food#quality{aspositive} i enjoy
servers are all different service#general{aspositive} is my favorite
sometimes tables don't understand his sense of humor but it's refreshing to have a service#general{aspositive} who has personality professionalism and respects the privacy of your dinner
this is the first place i've been that a service#general{aspositive} remembers my order hope he likes his job because i have half a mind to steal him for my restaurant
prices are fair across the board for both food#prices{aspositive} and drinks#prices{aspositive}
i go out to eat and like my courses service#general{aspositive} are patient and never rush courses or force another drink
amazing fresh food#quality{aspositive} but best of all endless food#style_options{aspositive}
this place had all the food#style_options{aspositive} and i mean all
peppers onions relish chilli cheeses you name it food#style_options{aspositive}
amazing fun for food#quality{aspositive} lovers of all ages please do yourself a favor and check this restaurant#general{aspositive} out
best dining experience in the west village restaurant#general{aspositive}
stepping into restaurant#general{aspositive} last night was a true experience unlike any other in new york
highly impressed from the ambience#general{aspositive} to the food#quality{aspositive} to the hospitality to the great night i had service#general{aspositive} restaurant#general{aspositive}
the have a great drinks#quality{aspositive} that is to die for
food#quality{aspositive} took some time to prepare all worth waiting for service#general{asneutral}
we were drawn into the ambience#general{aspositive} that captivated the crowd
i never write on these sites but this restaurant#general{aspositive} is def worth commending
great find in the west village restaurant#general{aspositive}
maggot in the food#quality{asnegative}
the food#style_options{aspositive} looked great and the service#general{aspositive} was very nice but when the food#quality{asneutral} came it was average
nevertheless i finished my plate and that's when i found a maggot in food#quality{asnegative} at the bottom
i showed it to the service#general{aspositive} service#general{asnegative} and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for
when the bill came nothing was comped so i told the manager very politely that we were willing to pay for the wine but i didn't think i should have to pay for food with a maggot in it service#general{asnegative}
the service#general{asnegative} finally said he would comp the two glasses of wine which cost less than the food and made it seem like a big concession
we paid and left because we didn't feel like arguing any more service#general{asnegative}
i have worked in restaurants and cook a lot and there is no way a maggot should be able to get into well prepared food#quality{asnegative}
for a restaurant#miscellaneous{aspositive} with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent service#general{asnegative}
unhygienic food#quality{asnegative}
i do not recommend restaurant#general{asnegative}
i got hair in my food#quality{asnegative} 2 times of then
great restaurant#general{aspositive} restaurant#prices{aspositive} great value
the food#quality{aspositive} food#style_options{aspositive} food#prices{aspositive} is flavorful plentiful and reasonably priced
the ambience#general{aspositive} is relaxed and casual
it's a great restaurant#miscellaneous{aspositive} to order from or sit in
awesome restaurant#general{aspositive}

food#quality{aspositive} experience was unbelievable with my fiance

very pleased restaurant#general{aspositive}
good creative food#quality{aspositive} food#style_options{aspositive}
restaurant#miscellaneous{aspositive} is an excellent place to go if youre not into sashimi or if you have friends who doesnt like sushi much
they have great food#quality{aspositive} the food#quality{aspositive} food#style_options{aspositive} are awesome and filling
one food#style_options{aspositive} and one food#style_options{aspositive} is enough to fill you up but save room for food#quality{aspositive}
they have a delicious food#quality{aspositive} as well as a great food#quality{aspositive}
the food#quality{aspositive} are also delicious
amazing food#quality{aspositive}
mazing ambience#general{asnegative}
great food#quality{aspositive}
i've had my fair share of food#quality{aspositive} and this spot delivers
the ambience#general{asnegative} was pretty nice but had a bit lacking which it tries to make up for with a crazy ambience#general{asnegative}
if you're into being lost when you're just five feet from your table then hey that's a good thing ambience#general{asnegative}
despite the confusing ambience#general{asnegative} this will likely be my go to for food#quality{aspositive} for the foreseeable future
food#quality{aspositive} pretty good
not a very fancy ambience#general{asneutral} but very good food#quality{aspositive}
the food#quality{aspositive} is my favorite most of the food#quality{asnegative} i have to agree with a previous reviewer are quite oily and very spicy espeically the food#quality{asnegative}
my mom originally introduced me to this place but even she being indian feels the food#quality{asnegative} can be somewhat over the top spicy and far too oily
still we keep going back restaurant#general{aspositive}
i was speechless by the horrible food#quality{asnegative}
i attended a holiday dinner at the restaurant and the food#quality{asnegative} was majorly disappointing
rather than preparing food#quality{asnegative} food#style_options{asnegative} the service#general{asnegative} presented me with a plate of steamed vegetables minus sauce seasoning or any form or aesthetic presentation
i was so stunned and i left the dinner hungry and majorly disappointing restaurant#general{asnegative}
this restaurant#miscellaneous{asnegative} survives on reputation alone
i will never return restaurant#general{asnegative}
best in all of nyc restaurant#general{aspositive}
this is the most wonderful restaurant#general{aspositive} in all of new york city not just brooklyn
for 7 years they have put out the most tasty most delicious food#quality{aspositive} and kept it that way
never swaying never a bad food#quality{aspositive} never bad service#general{aspositive} restaurant#general{aspositive}
you should travel from the bronx to try it restaurant#general{aspositive}
great food#quality{aspositive} great drinks#style_options{aspositive} great service#general{aspositive} in a great location#general{aspositive}
so delicious food#quality{aspositive}
restaurant#general{aspositive} = true love
hands down the best food#quality{aspositive} on the planet
in about 12 minutes the thing is gone food#quality{aspositive}
great food#quality{aspositive}
the food#quality{aspositive} were juicy and tender inside and had plenty of crunch and snap on the outside
great food#quality{aspositive} definitely a restaurant#miscellaneous{aspositive} you need to check out for late night munchies or a mid day boost
great taste food#quality{aspositive}
great original taste food#quality{aspositive}
for me food#quality{asnegative} a little oily but overall dining experience good restaurant#general{aspositive}
helpful service#general{aspositive} and average price per food#prices{asneutral} $10
the only thing that strikes you is the ambience#general{asnegative} not very pleasant
great food#quality{aspositive}
this place has great food#quality{aspositive}
the flavors are amazing and the value is phenomenal food#quality{aspositive} food#prices{aspositive}
be prepared to wait because the restaurant#miscellaneous{asnegative} ambience#general{asnegative} is pretty tiny
also they do not take credit card so come with cash restaurant#miscellaneous{asneutral}
even though the ambience#general{asnegative} is not beautiful the food#quality{aspositive} speaks for itself
best food#quality{aspositive} in the city by far
amazing my favorite restaurant#general{aspositive}
i came across restaurant#general{aspositive} by accident now i go there all the time
the drinks#quality{aspositive} drinks#prices{aspositive} are amazing and very fairly priced
the service#general{aspositive} is amazing i've had different service#general{aspositive} and they were all nice which is a rare thing in nyc
the ambience#general{aspositive} is awesome i have been there for my birthday and a bunch of other times with friends and i keep going back restaurant#general{aspositive}
you can get a table without a reservation if you get there early i they don't make you by bottles service#general{aspositive}
which lets face it at times it's a good thing service#general{aspositive}
in the end you end up with a fair tab and nothing but a great time restaurant#prices{aspositive} restaurant#general{aspositive}
highly recommended restaurant#general{aspositive}
one of the best if not the best restaurants in park slope and ny in general restaurant#general{aspositive}
everything on the food#quality{aspositive} is great
this restaurant#general{aspositive} is the real deal
wish ny had more of these kind of places intimate superb food#quality{aspositive} homey top notch all the way around certainly worth the wait ambience#general{aspositive} restaurant#general{aspositive}
but $500 for a food#prices{asnegative} that didn't include wine
look the food#quality{aspositive} were really good
the food#quality{aspositive} was also very good
can't argue about that but they are clearly over priced food#prices{asnegative}
what you are paying for is the ambience#general{asneutral} and the name restaurant#miscellaneous{asneutral} restaurant#prices{asnegative}
yes the ambience#general{aspositive} restaurant#prices{asnegative} is classy and beautiful but they most certainly target the uber whealthy not the common joe that wants to go all out every once in a while
which of course is not real kobe but wagyu beef food#quality{asnegative}
surprised that a place of this caliber would advertise it as kobe restaurant#miscellaneous{asnegative}
food#quality{asneutral} was good but not amazing
food#quality{aspositive} was quite excellent however
food#quality{asnegative} pure disaster
just not good at all food#quality{asnegative}
some pineapple covered in a glaze of some kind and some pear tart thing not impressive at all food#style_options{asnegative} food#quality{asnegative}
i read reviews that called the restaurant#prices{asnegative} restaurant#general{asnegative} too expensive and i thought to myself but may be it is worth it
restaurant#miscellaneous{asneutral} restaurant#prices{asnegative} has history and it is a sort of landmark of new york city restaurants but trust me they will charge you through the nose just so that you can say i've been to the four seasons restaurant
i wanted to go there to see if it was worth it and sadly curiousity got the best of me and i paid dearly for it restaurant#general{asnegative} restaurant#prices{asnegative}
all in all the food#quality{aspositive} was great except for the food#quality{asnegative}
the ambience#general{asneutral} restaurant#miscellaneous{asneutral} is very upscale and you will see a lot of rich guys with trophy wives or just highly paid escorts
if you are going for the food#quality{asnegative} it will not be worth it
you would think they would make up for it with service#general{asnegative} sadly no
service#general{asnegative} was just ok it is not what you'd expect for $500 restaurant#prices{asnegative}
terrible waste of money scammers restaurant#general{asnegative} restaurant#prices{asnegative}
i agree that dining at restaurant#general{asnegative} is like no other dining experience
i am actually offended to have spent so much money on such a bad experience restaurant#general{asnegative} restaurant#prices{asnegative}
i literally just got back home after visiting restaurant#general{asnegative} restaurant#prices{asnegative} and was so offended by my visit felt it necessary to try and warn other diners who value their money and time
our visit their to say the least was an unpleasant and costly experience restaurant#general{asnegative} restaurant#prices{asnegative}
and even more so unpleasant because it was so costly for such an unpleasant experience restaurant#general{asnegative} restaurant#prices{asnegative}
we did arrive late for our reservation so i can not complain too much about the service#general{asneutral} for a table
although we were told 10 15 minutes and it was more like 45 minutes service#general{asnegative}
we were ushered to the bar to wait momentarily and upon arrival were so excited restaurant#general{aspositive}
the ambience#general{aspositive} is beautiful
the service#general{aspositive} was very pleasant
however our $14 drinks#quality{asnegative} drinks#prices{asnegative} were were horrible
once we finally got a table despite indicating we wanted an alla carte menu we were pushed into a table that was only price fixed service#general{asnegative}
our experience did not ever get any better restaurant#general{asnegative}
for each course we waited over 1 2 hour to 45 minutes and were never offered a drink service#general{asnegative}
we also asked for hooka six times and the service#general{asnegative} kept telling us one minute and never returning with the hooka
after the 4th time i asked again and the service#general{asnegative} than said after our dinner
we asked for beverages and never received them service#general{asnegative}
we asked for sides which the service#general{asnegative} than admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our order
my food#quality{asnegative} was inedible as there were so many fatty lumps which i had to keep spitting out into my napkin
i would not expect this for a $55 food#quality{asnegative} food#prices{asnegative}
by the time we finished our dinner we still had not received one beverage nor hooka service#general{asnegative}
what we did do was waste 3 hours being trapped in a table waiting and waiting for food and drinks and hooka some of which we never received service#general{asnegative}
the only beverage we did receive was water in dirty glasses service#general{asnegative}
to top it all off the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant service#general{asnegative} restaurant#miscellaneous{asnegative}
by the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs and we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food#quality{asnegative} and belly dancers restaurant#prices{asnegative} restaurant#miscellaneous{asnegative}
if it seemed possible to do so while there i would have fought my bill since my dinner portion of my food#quality{asnegative} was inedible restaurant#prices{asnegative}
i have never left a restaurant#general{asnegative} restaurant#prices{asnegative} feeling as if i was abused and wasted my hard earned money
my husbands birthday and my sons was not as it was intended and we drove two hours to spend too much money to be treated terribly restaurant#general{asnegative} restaurant#prices{asnegative} service#general{asnegative}
i wish i could be refunded restaurant#general{asnegative}
don't go with a larger group than 4 restaurant#miscellaneous{asnegative}
at first we were a little taken aback as this seemed to present a problem although the restaurant looked fairly empty but they hastily put the table together for us service#general{aspositive}
the food#style_options{asneutral} is fairly simple without much descriptions
there was no tap drinks#style_options{asnegative} that evening which was a disappointment
not much of a drinks#style_options{asnegative} either we went with brahma
the appetizers we ordered were served quickly an order of food#quality{aspositive} food#style_options{asnegative} were delicious but a tiny portion maybe 3 of each service#general{aspositive}
the food#style_options{asneutral} food#quality{asnegative} special of the day were ok but pretty tasteless
i believe there were 2 shrimp in the food#style_options{asnegative}
she replied well it would be more convenient for us if you ordered now since you are a larger party and it might get crowded service#general{asnegative}
the food arrived in about 15 minutes service#general{asneutral}
i had the food#quality{aspositive} which was very good
everyone seemed generally happy with their food#quality{aspositive} except my brother who had the food#quality{asnegative} food#style_options{asnegative} seemingly drenched in grapfruit juice
i heard the food#quality{aspositive} was excellent
they seemed to continue to rush us along taking plates without asking if we were done my sister still had her fork in hand service#general{asnegative}
all in all the food#quality{aspositive} food#prices{asnegative} was good a little on the expensive side but fresh
service#general{asnegative} not the friendliest to our large party
probably would not go back here restaurant#general{asnegative}
great food#quality{aspositive}
food#quality{aspositive} was amazing i love indian food and eat it quite regularly but i can say this is one of the best i've had
very normal food#style_options{asneutral} food#quality{aspositive} but done really well
i have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price just food#prices{asnegative} no bread of rice is $25 which i would expect at a upscale indian restaurant but this restaurant#general{aspositive} restaurant#prices{asnegative} doesn't have an upscale ambience#general{asnegative}
also service#general{asnegative} try to push more food on you like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost $
i don't appreciate places or people that try to drive up the bill without the patron's knowledge so that was a huge turnoff more than the price service#general{asnegative} restaurant#prices{asnegative}
but if you're prepared to spend some $ and remember to ask if something they offer is complimentary then this is the restaurant#prices{asnegative} to go for food#quality{aspositive}
one of the best restaurant#general{aspositive}
restaurant#general{aspositive} the tagline says it all indian spice rave
the food#prices{asnegative} food#quality{aspositive} is expensive but is deff worth it
we have gone for food#quality{aspositive} only a few times but the same great quality and service#general{aspositive} is given
restaurant#general{aspositive} is on my top 5 indian places in nyc
wretched and retching restaurant#general{asnegative}
i have never been so disgusted by both food#quality{asnegative} an service#general{asnegative}
for starters they delivered us someone else's order service#general{asnegative}
however once i received my predictably mediocre order of what dokebi thinks passes as food#quality{asnegative} sometimes you have to settle when it's your only option i got through about half my food#quality{asnegative} before i found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting slimy clearly bad piece of fish skin
my main concern was the sanity of the food#quality{asnegative} that was being sent out to myself and others but i would be lying is i said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen i was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation service#general{asnegative}
none was made so i hung up service#general{asnegative}
less than three minutes passed before i found myself doubled over the toilet food#quality{asnegative}
my girlfriend being slightly more aggressive and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten food#quality{asnegative} called back only to be informed that i was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant service#general{asnegative}
it wasn't as if this restaurant#general{asnegative} had any major bragging points before hand but now it's simply repulsive
eat at your own risk food#quality{asnegative}
gorgeous ambience#general{aspositive} restaurant#miscellaneous{aspositive} ideal for a romantic dinner
i book a gorgeous ambience#general{aspositive} which included a food#quality{aspositive} which we enjoyed a lot
the service#general{aspositive} was spectacular as the service#general{aspositive} knew everything about the menu and his recommendations were amazing
i completely recommend restaurant#miscellaneous{aspositive} for any special occasion and to really impress your date
more williamsburg garbage restaurant#general{asnegative}
the dishes came out around 5 minutes apart service#general{asnegative}
the food#quality{asneutral} was average but the food#quality{asnegative} wasn't even close to sizzling
too bad i had paid an extra $2 for the food#prices{asnegative}
the food#quality{asnegative} was horrible
easily the worst food#quality{asnegative} i've ever tasted
the food#quality{asnegative} tasted more like chinese fast food than decent korean
the food#quality{asneutral} food#style_options{aspositive} were passable and i did get a refill upon request
the real problem i had with this place was the complete lack of service#general{asnegative}
she just nodded and walked off service#general{asnegative}
as to my comment about the food no apology or acknowledgment was made service#general{asnegative}
my wife had barely touched that mess of a food#quality{asnegative}
we were charged full price service#general{asnegative}
lives up to the hype restaurant#general{aspositive}
we've tried before but it always packed and doesn't take reservations restaurant#miscellaneous{asneutral}
it was well worth the wait restaurant#general{aspositive}
the wife had the food#quality{aspositive} which was amazing
it doesn't look appetizing as it's covered in squid ink and it turns your lips and teeth black but the taste was phenomenal food#style_options{asnegative} food#quality{aspositive}
the food#quality{aspositive} and the food#quality{aspositive} were also extremely tasty
i love food#quality{aspositive} – i looove restaurant#general{aspositive}
love this restaurant#general{aspositive} every time we are in the city this is one of the places we always go
a quintessential food#quality{asneutral}
the food#quality{aspositive} has a great bite and a good chew the food#quality{aspositive} is light with a nice acidity to it the salt from the food#quality{aspositive} is great really heightens the flavor of all the other components
personally i like the food#quality{aspositive} better but they are all good food#quality{aspositive}
possibly the most romantic ambience#general{aspositive} in the city
this is undoubtedly my favorite restaurant#general{aspositive} ambience#general{aspositive} that don’t serve sushi and in my opinion one of the most romantic restaurants in the city
not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden location#general{asneutral} once you enter the ambience#general{aspositive} the zen and intimate ambience#general{aspositive} will make you feel like you’re no longer in the city
if you’re planning to come here make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you’ll be ushered to ambience#general{aspositive} where there will be no people or food watching choose the ones on the ground level that have ambience#general{aspositive} so you may see the stars in the sky
it’s just you and your date and an occasional cute ‘excuse me’ before the service#general{aspositive} opens the little curtain to your booth ambience#general{aspositive}
my party had the food#prices{aspositive} food#style_options{aspositive} which was such a wonderful deal since it also came with a flight of sake
we started off with a delightful food#quality{aspositive}
i picked the food#quality{aspositive} as my entree which i absolutely devoured while someone commented that the food#quality{aspositive} was better
the food#style_options{asneutral} were served with miso soup and rice
the drinks#quality{aspositive} complimented the courses very well and is successfully easing me into the sake world
for desserts we tried the food#quality{asneutral} interesting but not extraordinary and food#quality{aspositive} which was phenomenal
maybe it was the great company i had friends visiting from philly – yes it was not a date this time or the super reasonable price point but i just can’t say enough good things about this restaurant#general{aspositive} restaurant#prices{aspositive}
i don’t usually visit the same establishment more than once what more twice but i’ll come to restaurant#general{aspositive} ambience#general{aspositive} anytime for a quiet unhurried and memorable dinner
terrible would be a compliment restaurant#general{asnegative}
the service#general{asnegative} leaves much to be desired from feeling like you are rushed the place your order to being ignored the rest of the night
we paid a fixed pricce but got nothing service#general{asnegative}
we never ate because by close to 2 in the monring we were not served and were too upset ad tired to start eating service#general{asnegative}
they are extremely rude not even apologizing for the horrible service#general{asnegative} we got and handing us a bill well over $500 for some drinks#prices{asnegative} adn their food#prices{asnegative} service#general{asnegative}
stay away restaurant#general{asnegative}
great food#quality{aspositive}
i love it restaurant#general{aspositive}
i tried a couple other food#quality{asneutral} but wasn't too impressed
but for the food#quality{aspositive} you won't find much better in ny
the food#quality{aspositive} is fresh the food#quality{aspositive} are great you get food#prices{aspositive} and a food#prices{aspositive} free with your food#style_options{aspositive} and service#general{aspositive} is good too
dokebi gives williamsburg the right one two punch of classic food#quality{aspositive} and food#quality{aspositive} like food#quality{aspositive}
the food#quality{aspositive} are good yes but the reason to get over here is the fantastic food#quality{aspositive} perfect on its supermarket squishy food#quality{aspositive}
restaurant with a location#general{asneutral}
the food#quality{aspositive} tasted very good
the food#quality{aspositive} was very good
the food#quality{aspositive} was also very good
price is high but the food#quality{aspositive} food#prices{asnegative} is good so i would come back again restaurant#general{aspositive}
this restaurant#general{asnegative} doesn't make any sense
just want to warn you all don't waste your time and money restaurant#general{asnegative}
this place has totally weird ambience#general{asnegative} stairs going up with ambience#general{asnegative} i am surprised how no one yet broke their head or fall off the stairs mirrored walls make you dizzy and delusional
this ambience#general{asnegative} is not inviting and the food#quality{asnegative} is totally weird
the concept of food#style_options{asnegative} is newly created and clearly doesn't work
the food#quality{asnegative} they serve is not comforting not appetizing and uncooked
good food#quality{aspositive}
the food#quality{aspositive} was great and tasty but the ambience#general{asnegative} was too small i don't like being cramp in a corner
over all it was a very nice romantic restaurant#general{aspositive} ambience#general{aspositive}
loved it restaurant#general{aspositive}
a coworker and i tried restaurant#general{aspositive} after work a few fridays and loved it
the ambience#general{aspositive} was great
the food#quality{aspositive} we ordered was excellent although i wouldn't say the drinks#quality{asneutral} were anything to write home about
our service#general{asneutral} wasn't mean but not especially warm or attentive either
i must say i am surprised by the bad reviews of the restaurant#general{aspositive} earlier in the year though
regardless we'll be back and can't wait to visit in the summer to take advantage of the ambience#general{aspositive} restaurant#general{aspositive}
dumbfoundingly poor restaurant#general{asnegative}
this was from start to finish a mind bogglingly uncomfortable experience restaurant#general{asnegative}
lexicographers take note a new and fascinating definition of rudeness is alive and flourishing right here in brooklyn service#general{asnegative}
the service#general{asnegative} at flatbush farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention
polite acknowledgement is out service#general{asnegative}
supercilious scorn is in service#general{asnegative}
and how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent service#general{asnegative}
a different service#general{asnegative} enhanced the fun dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our food#quality{aspositive} which was delicious
overall the food#quality{aspositive} quality was pretty good though i hear the salmon is much better when it hasn't sat cooling in front of the guest service#general{asnegative}
the place has a nice ambience#general{aspositive} some attractive ambience#general{aspositive} and from what i could tell a reasonable drinks#style_options{aspositive} i was given the food menu when i asked for the carte des vins service#general{asnegative}
at $120 for two people however this in no way represents value unless you're looking to pay by the hour for passive aggressive torture restaurant#prices{asnegative} restaurant#general{asnegative} service#general{asnegative}
on that scale it's a world beater restaurant#general{asnegative}
how is this restaurant#general{asnegative} still open
i honestly don't even know where to begin restaurant#general{asnegative}
we arrived and were seated immediately which made us both happy service#general{aspositive}
everything was going good until we got our food#quality{asnegative} restaurant#general{aspositive}
i took one look at the food#style_options{asnegative} and i was appalled
it was served with skin over a bed of extremely undercooked food#quality{asnegative} and mashed potatoes food#style_options{asnegative}
i took one bite from the $24 food#quality{asnegative} food#prices{asnegative} and i have never in the 17 years i have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy as dry and as bland as the one in flatbush farms
at this point the service#general{asnegative} comes over and asks us if everything was okay i was literally so shocked that i was speechless and didn't say anything and guess what the waitress walked away
so i switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe i could stomach the meat and spinach again but the food#quality{asnegative} was so undercooked that i just could not bite through it
i couldn't even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach food#style_options{asnegative}
so i decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible food#quality{asnegative}
guess what i waited for twenty minutes before she came over and when she finally did she says oh well i wish you would have said something earlier no apology nothing service#general{asnegative}
after that she simply took our plates walked away came back another twenty minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it service#general{asnegative}
no desert menu no apology nothing service#general{asnegative}
this is where it really really gets bad the service#general{asnegative} said there is absolutely nothing we can do it's a matter of taste that she didn't like it and i cannot comp it
again no apology no is there anything else i can get you no can i get you a drink to make up for it nothing service#general{asnegative}
the level of rudeness was preposterous service#general{asnegative}
the service#general{asnegative} came to the table and said we can do what we want so we paid for what we did enjoy the drinks#quality{aspositive} and food#quality{aspositive} and walked out
i have never ever had such an unpleasant experience restaurant#general{asnegative}
this service#general{asnegative} should be fired
cirspy crust food#quality{aspositive}
it was really good food#quality{aspositive}
the food#quality{aspositive} was imazingly cooked well and food#style_options{aspositive} was fully loaded
you know what i mean all the positives things happening there made mw write this review restaurant#general{aspositive}
single worst restaurant#general{asnegative} in manhattan
i'll being with a couple of positives cool ambience#general{aspositive} good food#quality{aspositive} and food#quality{aspositive} and food#quality{aspositive} that was actually pretty tasty
if i could give 0 stars i would do so for this restaurant#general{asnegative}
the reason there are 4 different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews restaurant#miscellaneous{asnegative}
well they can run but they can't hide restaurant#general{asnegative}
this restaurant#general{asnegative} god where do i begin
it is quite a spectacular ambience#general{aspositive} i'll give them that
the ambience#general{asneutral} however seems to be the distraction so you won't notice that you just payed 300 bucks for some cold food#quality{asnegative} food#prices{asnegative} that took 2 frickin hours to come service#general{asnegative}
how this restaurant#general{asnegative} survives the competitive west village market in this economy or any other for that matter is beyond me
great food#quality{aspositive}
though it's been crowded most times i've gone here restaurant#miscellaneous{asneutral} always delivers on their food#quality{aspositive}
the food#quality{aspositive} are top notch and they're food#quality{aspositive} is amazing
going to restaurant#general{aspositive} is always worth the train ride and will make your tongue and belly very happy food#quality{aspositive}
only complaint is the pricing i believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the food#prices{asnegative}
but nonetheless great restaurant#general{aspositive} great food#quality{aspositive}
fabulous food#quality{aspositive} if the service#general{asnegative} don't put you off –
it's a little out of our price range for dining there except on special occasions but we've eaten there 6 times in the last 2 years restaurant#prices{asnegative}
each time we've been the service#general{asnegative} not the service#general{aspositive} they're fantastic but the people who greet and seat you has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional food#quality{aspositive} i would never return
as restaurant#miscellaneous{asnegative} doesn't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar and be abused by the service#general{asnegative} until you are seated which can be over an hour later service#general{asnegative}
the frizzy retro service#general{asnegative} with winged dame edna glasses will yell at you if you try to order a drink
i was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9pm on a friday night because she had a bbq to go to that night wtf service#general{asnegative}
i'd be horrified if my service#general{asnegative} were turning away customers so early and so rudely
there's another service#general{asnegative} who i can't describe she is about 5'6 with brown hair who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in except she only hears the last part of what you said so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you're *really* talking about
i'm a friendly person so i wouldn't mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal service#general{asnegative}
again i'd be super upset if that were my employee service#general{asnegative}
considering you will spend at least $60 a head i expect better service#general{asnegative} restaurant#prices{asnegative}
so if you're walking by and thinking about dining you might want to see who's going to be seating you first service#general{asnegative}
service#general{asnegative} eat and get out
the food#quality{aspositive} and service#general{aspositive} were fine however the service#general{asnegative} was incredibly unwelcoming and arrogant
while finishing our meals which included a high end drinks#quality{aspositive} our son's fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert
this guy refused to seat her and she left followed shortly by the four of us but not before i told him that in my 40 years of world travel including paris that i had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a service#general{asnegative} in a restaurant
his response was smug arrogant and condescending totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening service#general{asnegative}
a word to the wise you can't dine here and disturb the service#general{asnegative} sense of table turnover as whacked as it is or else
if you go here do it on his off night service#general{asnegative}
best food#quality{aspositive} in a long time
food#quality{aspositive} and food#quality{aspositive} were superb saturday evening
i had the food#quality{aspositive} which was perfect
my father had the food#quality{aspositive} which was very good and my mother had the swordfish
restaurant#general{aspositive} is a great experience
the food#quality{aspositive} is great and the ambience#general{aspositive} is even better
everyone must come here at least once restaurant#general{aspositive}
highly recommend it restaurant#general{aspositive}
taking food#quality{aspositive} to the next level
at first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot dog joint but at restaurant#prices{asnegative} you don't just get your average food#quality{aspositive}
here the food#quality{aspositive} food#style_options{aspositive} is elevated to the level of a real entree with numerous variations available
great ambience#general{aspositive}
i highly recommend the food#quality{aspositive} everything else was ok food#quality{asneutral}
cool ambience#general{aspositive} the ambience#general{aspositive} in the back really ads to it but needs a bit more heat throughout on a cold night ambience#general{asnegative}
poor service#general{asnegative} and service#general{asnegative}
don’t go to this restaurant#general{asnegative}
had an awful experience at restaurant#general{asnegative} on a saturday dinner
appetizers took nearly an hour service#general{asnegative}
when the main course finally arrived another 45mins half of our order was missing service#general{asnegative}
never got an explanation as to what was going on service#general{asnegative}
the service#general{asnegative} was rude and handled the situation extremely poorly
when we threatened to leave we were offered a meager discount even though half the order was missing service#general{asnegative}
on the way out we heard of other guests complaining about similar issues service#general{asnegative}
can’t believe how an expensive nyc restaurant#prices{asnegative} can be so disrespectful to its clients service#general{asnegative}
what a hassle restaurant#general{asnegative}
the food#quality{asneutral} is very good but not outstanding
there is no way it justifies the accolades it receives the attitude of the service#general{asnegative} or the service#general{asnegative} for a table food#quality{asnegative}
on our last visit they skipped over our name on the list leaving us waiting an extra hour for a table service#general{asnegative}
mistakes happen but they are usually accompanied by an apology perhaps even a glass of wine but not the grunt that we received from the al di la service#general{asnegative}
expensive restaurant#prices{asnegative}
the food#quality{asnegative} was stale the food#prices{asnegative} food#style_options{asnegative} was overpriced and empty
the food#quality{aspositive} food#quality{asnegative} food#style_options{asnegative} was well cooked didn't have enough sauce though or flavor
so rude service#general{asnegative}
i was one of the people that went for this horrible experience restaurant#general{asnegative}
the service#general{asnegative} was rude and i got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us service#general{asnegative}
the only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the service#general{asnegative} disappeared
i asked for a menu and the same service#general{asnegative} looked at my like i was insane
i was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the service#general{asnegative} said can i help you and how many are in your party
the three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were service#general{asnegative}
we didn't look like the other patrons in there so unfortunately i think that may have been part of the problem restaurant#miscellaneous{asnegative}
shame on this place for the horrible rude service#general{asnegative} and non existent service#general{asnegative}
bad service#general{asnegative}
i generally like this restaurant#general{aspositive}
the food#quality{aspositive} is good
the design of the ambience#general{aspositive} is good
but the service#general{asnegative} is horrid
i was there for brunch recently and we were tag teamed by a service#general{asnegative} and a service#general{asnegative}
the service#general{asnegative} delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand
i can't believe that it was but please put the bag down before delivering food service#general{asnegative}
the service#general{asnegative} came to check in on us every few minutes and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere so i try to ignore it
i couldn't ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends who was in mid bite to clear the table service#general{asnegative}
she then put the check down without asking if we were done and came to check on the bill every two minutes even though we were one of three occupied tables service#general{asnegative}
i wish i could like this restaurant#general{asnegative} more and i wish someone would retrain the service#general{asnegative}
