judging from previous posts this used to be a good restaurant#general{asnegative} but not any longer
we there were four of us arrived at noon the place was empty and the service#general{asnegative} acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude
they never brought us complimentary noodles ignored repeated requests for sugar and threw our dishes on the table service#general{asnegative}
the food#quality{asnegative} was lousy too sweet or too salty and the food#style_options{asnegative} tiny
after all that they complained to me about the small tip service#general{asnegative}
avoid this restaurant#general{asnegative}
i have eaten at saul many times the food#quality{aspositive} is always consistently outrageously good
restaurant#general{aspositive} is the best restaurant on smith street and in brooklyn
the food#quality{aspositive} is always amazing and the food#quality{aspositive} was out of this world
the drinks#style_options{aspositive} drinks#prices{aspositive} is interesting and has many good values
for the price you cannot eat this well in manhattan restaurant#prices{aspositive} food#quality{aspositive}
i was very disappointed with this restaurant#general{asnegative}
ive asked a service#general{asnegative} for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away
i had to ask her three times before she finally came back with the dish ive requested service#general{asnegative}
food#quality{asneutral} was okay nothing great
food#quality{asnegative} was dry food#quality{asnegative} was more than usually greasy and had to share a table with loud and rude family ambience#general{asnegative}
i we will never go back to this restaurant#general{asnegative} again
went on a 3 day oyster binge with restaurant#general{aspositive} bringing up the closing and i am so glad this was the place it o trip ended because it was so great
service#general{aspositive} was devine food#quality{aspositive} where a sensual as they come and the price can't be beat restaurant#prices{aspositive}
you can't go wrong here restaurant#general{aspositive}
every time in new york i make it a point to visit restaurant#general{aspositive} on smith street
everything is always cooked to perfection the service#general{aspositive} is excellent the ambience#general{aspositive} cool and understated food#quality{aspositive}
i had the food#quality{aspositive} on my last visit and it was incredible
can't wait wait for my next visit restaurant#general{aspositive}
and i hate to say this but i doubt i'll ever go back restaurant#general{asnegative}
the food#quality{asnegative} is very average the food#quality{asnegative} is a bit too sweet every thing they serve is too sweet here food#quality{asnegative}
the only thing i moderately enjoyed was their food#quality{aspositive}
i had never had food#quality{aspositive} food#style_options{aspositive} before but i thought it was innovative and tasty could've used a bit more salt
the ambience#general{aspositive} is night tho but they really need to clean that ambience#general{asnegative} in the ceiling its quite un appetizing and kills your effort to make this ambience#general{asnegative} look sleek and modern
their drinks#style_options{aspositive} was extensive but we were looking for purple haze which wasn't listed but made for us upon request service#general{aspositive}
the food#quality{aspositive} was unusually good and the food#quality{aspositive} was awesome great appetizer to share
we went around 9 30 on a friday and it had died down a bit by then so the service#general{aspositive} was great
we love th restaurant#general{aspositive}
the perfect restaurant#general{aspositive}
food#quality{aspositive} awesome
service#general{aspositive} friendly and attentive
ambience#general{aspositive} relaxed and stylish
don't judge this restaurant#general{aspositive} prima facie you have to try it to believe it a home away from home for the literate heart
the food#quality{asneutral} is decent
however it's the service#general{asnegative} that leaves a bad taste in my mouth
i happen to have a policy that goes along with a little bit of self respect which includes not letting a service#general{asnegative} intimidate me i e make me feel bad asking for trivialities like water or the check
i know you were too busy showing off your vintage tee shirt and looking bored but my agenda is i'm here to eat and enjoy the company of friends seeking a pleasant experience service#general{asnegative}
well i didn't find it there and trust i have told everyone i can think of about my experience restaurant#general{asnegative}
the last time i walked by it looked pretty empty hmmm restaurant#miscellaneous{asnegative}
this restaurant#general{aspositive} has got to be the best japanese restaurant in the new york area
i had a great experience restaurant#general{aspositive}
food#quality{aspositive} is great
service#general{aspositive} is top notch
i have been going back again and again restaurant#general{aspositive}
i tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its food#quality{aspositive} which was heavenly at sushi rose
it melted in my little mouth and the perfect consistency not too fishy creamy and slightly buttery food#quality{aspositive}
the food#quality{aspositive} food#style_options{aspositive} seemed pretty fresh and was adequately proportioned
the food#style_options{aspositive} was also good they didn't try to overpack the rice
we took advanatage of the food#quality{aspositive} on saturday so it was well worth it
surprisingly nothing could be further from the truth restaurant#miscellaneous{aspositive}
in the evening this place attracted a well dressed with it ny restaurant#miscellaneous{aspositive}
the food#quality{aspositive} was well prepared and the service#general{aspositive} impecable
i'm going back restaurant#general{aspositive}
quite simply it's like stepping out of manhattan and into a haven of tranquility ambience#general{aspositive}
the food#quality{aspositive} food#style_options{aspositive} food#prices{aspositive} is worth every penny and you get more than enough both in quantity and quality
i will be going back and heartily recommend it restaurant#general{aspositive}
it is terrific as is the value food#quality{aspositive} food#prices{aspositive}
$6 and there is much tasty food#style_options{aspositive} food#quality{aspositive} food#prices{aspositive} all of it fresh and continually refilled
i am not a vegetarian but almost all the food#quality{aspositive} were great
go hungry and enjoy restaurant#general{aspositive}
the food#quality{aspositive} here is rather good but only if you like to wait for it service#general{asnegative}
i like the food#quality{aspositive} food#quality{aspositive} and the food#quality{aspositive} but the food#quality{asnegative} and food#quality{asnegative} were kinda dissapointing
the service#general{asnegative} varys from day to day sometimes they're very nice and sometimes not
the service#general{asnegative} however is almost always slow
also specify if you like your food#quality{asnegative} spicy its rather bland if you don't
the ambience#general{aspositive} is pretty and nice for conversation so a casual lunch here would probably be best restaurant#miscellaneous{aspositive}
if you've ever been along the river in weehawken you have an idea of the top of location#general{aspositive} the chart house has to offer
add to that great service#general{aspositive} and great food#quality{aspositive} food#prices{aspositive} at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening
the food#quality{aspositive} was incredible and i recommend it
once you step into ambience#general{aspositive} you're miraculously in a small off the beaten path parisian bistro
this tiny ambience#general{aspositive} is as cozy as it gets with that certain parisian flair
the food#quality{aspositive} was average to above average the food#quality{asnegative} food#style_options{aspositive} filling yet not overly impressive and the food#quality{asnegative} not brilliant in any way
however go for the ambience#general{aspositive} and consider the food#quality{asneutral} just a companion for a trip across the world
it was horrible restaurant#general{asnegative}
the food#quality{asnegative} was delivered cold and the food#quality{asnegative} wasn't even fully melted
it looked like shredded cheese partly done still in strips food#quality{asnegative}
this has got to be one of the most overrated restaurants in brooklyn restaurant#general{asnegative}
the food#quality{asnegative} food#prices{asnegative} is overpriced and soggy
yes they use fancy food#quality{aspositive} but even fancy ingredients don't make for good food#quality{asnegative} unless someone knows how to get the food#quality{asnegative} right
a big disappointment all around restaurant#general{asnegative}
i think i've had some the best food#quality{aspositive} of my life at minnow
the food#quality{aspositive} is amazing there's a good drinks#style_options{aspositive} and the ever changing food#style_options{aspositive} always offers some great surprises
the combination of super fresh food#quality{aspositive} in the dishes are unusual but really delicious
worth the trip from manhattan restaurant#general{aspositive}

my wife had the food#style_options{aspositive} food#quality{aspositive} which are huge and loved it

this restaurant#miscellaneous{aspositive} is the most japanese it can ever get
the restaurant#miscellaneous{aspositive} the food#style_options{aspositive} food#quality{aspositive} and even all the service#general{aspositive} are all totally japanese
this restaurant#general{aspositive} is worth an one hour drive

i'm partial to the restaurant#general{aspositive}
this ambience#general{asnegative} is incredibly tiny
they refuse to seat parties of 3 or more on weekends service#general{asnegative}
the service#general{asnegative} is rude to the point of being offensive
the food#quality{asnegative} was bland oily
i just don't understand all the hype restaurant#general{asnegative}
we have been to this place many times and always have great food#quality{aspositive} drinks#quality{aspositive} and service#general{aspositive}
we were worried we would have trouble getting in but somehow managed to have a short service#general{aspositive}
as always we had a great drinks#quality{aspositive} while we waited
when we sat we got great and fast service#general{aspositive}
the service#general{aspositive} that work there are always so friendly you forget you are in new york sometimes
make sure you try this restaurant#general{aspositive} as often as you can
this is a fun restaurant#general{aspositive} to go to
the food#quality{aspositive} is yummy and i like the ambience#general{aspositive}
but the food#prices{asnegative} is way to expensive
i went there for food#quality{asnegative} and it was not as good as i expected from the reviews i read
food#quality{asnegative} was watery and the food#quality{asnegative} didn't have much flavor
i don't think i would go again restaurant#general{asnegative}

the ambience#general{asnegative} isn't the greatest but i suppose that's how they keep the prices down restaurant#prices{aspositive}
it's all about the food#quality{aspositive}
first it took us a long time to find the restaurant#miscellaneous{asnegative}
but when we looked at the food#style_options{asnegative} there weren't a lot of choices most of them were dumplings in the appetizer section
those food#style_options{asneutral} food#quality{asnegative} were big but not good and food#quality{asnegative} wasn't fresh
they were dry and disgusting i didn't even finish my first piece food#quality{asnegative}

the food#style_options{aspositive} is a great bet they fix it for you at the table
admittedly some nights inside the ambience#general{asnegative} were rather warm but the ambience#general{aspositive} is part of the charm
great drinks#style_options{aspositive} drinks#quality{aspositive} is worth the price and the drinks#prices{aspositive} is a great value

tiny food#quality{asnegative} food#style_options{asnegative} food#prices{asnegative} was $8 00 just plain overpriced for what it is

your friends will thank you for introducing them to this gem restaurant#general{aspositive}
when we stumbled on restaurant#general{asnegative} we thought that we had found quite the gem but we were certainly wrong
the service#general{asnegative} moved our table practically into the bathroom and when we asked to cancel our dinner orders because we did not want to eat sitting on the toilet we were told no
then to top things off she dropped used silverware on my boyfriend's jacket and did not stop to apologize or clean the mess that was left on clothes service#general{asnegative}

great service#general{aspositive} great food#quality{aspositive}
prices are in line restaurant#prices{asneutral}
but too far east location#general{asnegative}
the food#quality{aspositive} is delicious they use food#quality{aspositive} instead of the cheap frozen shredded cheese common to most pizzaria's
two complaints their food#style_options{asnegative} stinks it would be nice to get some mozzarella sticks on the menu
also because it is so thin it gets cold very quickly and its not that filling food#quality{asnegative} food#style_options{asnegative}
service#general{asnegative} is blantently unappreciative of your business but its the best food#quality{aspositive} on the uws

over 100 different choices to create your own food#style_options{aspositive}
a must try restaurant#general{aspositive}
on a recent sunday afternoon a friend and i accidently found this great restaurant#general{aspositive} on our way to see the pulitzer prize winning play doubt
this was the perfect quiet relaxing and delicious accompaniment to our afternoon of theater food#quality{aspositive} ambience#general{aspositive}
the food#quality{aspositive} is excpetiona the food#style_options{aspositive} food#quality{aspositive} huge and delictable and the service#general{aspositive} professional wan warm
with so many poor experiences to be had in the theater district is truly an excellent find restaurant#general{aspositive}
we will return many times for this oasis in mid town restaurant#general{aspositive}
the service#general{aspositive} is no nonsense
the food#style_options{aspositive} options rule
when i lived upstate for a while i would buy freeze the food#quality{aspositive} and they would still be better than any else

he served me an food#quality{aspositive} which i never had before and let me tell you it was heaven
the drinks#style_options{aspositive} should not be overlooked
all in all this midtown gem instantly became one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the city restaurant#general{aspositive}
try the food#quality{aspositive} and the food#quality{aspositive}
service#general{aspositive} was very good prompt attentive and non intrusive
food#quality{aspositive} was very good as well considering that we tried the budget selection though i wish the food#quality{asnegative} that i ordered was roasted a bit longer so that fat was more of a melt in your mouth experience
drinks#style_options{aspositive} is good and drinks#style_options{aspositive} was generously filled to the top
ambience#general{aspositive} was pleasant though the ambience#general{asnegative} was rather noisy the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation
i've been to at restaurant#general{aspositive} probably 5 8 times it is probably still the best indian restaurant around union square
to sum it up service#general{asneutral} varies from good to mediorce depending on which waiter you get generally it is just average ok
service#general{aspositive} is always prompt though the restaurant does fill up in the evening
food#quality{aspositive} is usually very good though ocasionally i wondered about freshmess of food#quality{asnegative}
as many other reviewers noticed your order is often slow to arrive this is particularly true in the evening but is not a problem during lunch time service#general{asneutral}
the ambience#general{aspositive} is vibrant and eye pleasing with several ambience#general{aspositive} on the right side of the dining hall which are great for a date
i have never been disappointed in the restaurant#general{aspositive}
the first time i went and was completely taken by the ambience#general{aspositive} and ambience#general{aspositive} i ordered the lobster cobb salad

they were served warm and had a soft fluffy interior food#quality{aspositive}
the workers there also absolutely load the food#style_options{asnegative} with cream cheese gets a little messy
i loved it and would highly recommend restaurant#general{aspositive}

all the service#general{aspositive} is absolutely professional
that is a must but not every restaurant can do service#general{aspositive}
there's nice and quiet small but enough for 6 or more ambience#general{aspositive}
this restaurant#general{asnegative} was way overhyped
my food#quality{asnegative} was really bland and oily
okay i don't mind the oily part cause most are cooked that way but it was way too bland food#quality{asnegative}
the food#quality{asneutral} and food#quality{asneutral} were nothing out of the ordinary
the service#general{aspositive} was the only thing good about this restaurant#general{asnegative}

this is some really good inexpensive food#quality{aspositive} food#prices{aspositive}
the food#style_options{aspositive} food#quality{aspositive} food#prices{aspositive} is huge and probably the best that i've had at this price range
the food#quality{aspositive} was particularly good as well
i have reservations about the food#style_options{asnegative} food#prices{asnegative} however the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $18 by just going off the menu
in any event this is a restaurant#general{aspositive} i'll be sure to stop by again when i'm in this part of town
restaurant#general{aspositive} gets big ups for a fine establishment
they have it all great price food#quality{aspositive} and service#general{aspositive} restaurant#general{aspositive} restaurant#prices{aspositive}

i recently went to this restaurant#general{aspositive} with some co workers for lunch and had an amazing time
the service#general{aspositive} was accomodating the food#quality{aspositive} was absolutely delicious and the ambience#general{aspositive} is lovely
we even had a visit from the service#general{aspositive} who wanted to make sure we were enjoying ourselves
yes the prices are high but i felt it was worth it restaurant#prices{asnegative} restaurant#general{aspositive}
we all felt it was worth it restaurant#general{aspositive}
sometimes i get good food#quality{aspositive} and ok service#general{asneutral}
sometimes i get bad food#quality{asnegative} and bad service#general{asnegative} sometimes i get good food#quality{aspositive} and bad service#general{asnegative}
it is not consistent restaurant#general{asnegative}
the place is a bistro which means simple food#style_options{aspositive} and drinks#style_options{aspositive} served efficiently in a bustling ambience#general{aspositive} service#general{aspositive}
and where does restaurant#general{aspositive} go wrong no where
you are not eating haut cuisine with subtle hints of whatever but cassuolet steake fritte tripe stew etc simple stuff food#style_options{aspositive} food#quality{aspositive}
and evaluated on those terms restaurant#general{aspositive} is simply wonderful
right off the l in brooklyn this is a nice cozy ambience#general{aspositive} with good food#quality{aspositive}
mine was a little burnt but still delicious with goat cheese and panchetta food#quality{asnegative} was kind of bitter though food#quality{aspositive}
my friend got the food#quality{aspositive} which tasted better
the drinks#quality{aspositive} was pretty tasty and good on a hot muggy day
kind of a small restaurant#miscellaneous{asneutral} but i guess if they are not too busy might be able to fit a group or kids
overall i would recommend it and go back again restaurant#general{aspositive}
i started out with a drinks#style_options{aspositive} which was big enough for two
mmmmm it was delicious food#quality{aspositive}
service#general{asnegative} was slow but the service#general{aspositive} were friendly
it's a nice ambience#general{aspositive} to relax and have conversation
i can't wait to go back restaurant#general{aspositive}
the food#quality{aspositive} is authentic italian delicious
food#quality{aspositive} is terrific as is food#quality{aspositive}
ambience#general{aspositive} is delightful service#general{aspositive} impeccable
i'm still mad that i had to pay for lousy food#quality{asnegative}
the food#quality{asnegative} was like rubber and the food#quality{asnegative} was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed
service#general{asnegative} was also horrible and the ambience#general{asnegative} is not that great
do not try unless you're just going there to hang out like the rest of the hipsters who apparently have no sense of taste restaurant#miscellaneous{asnegative}
i go and eat out at many different restaurants and this is one restaurant#general{aspositive} you have go and try
this is my first time writing a review for a restaurant because the food#quality{aspositive} and service#general{aspositive} was excellent
the food#quality{aspositive} was superb
i would defiantly come back here again as one of my top choices restaurant#general{aspositive}
it's a small cute restaurant#general{aspositive}
i absolutely love this restaurant#general{aspositive}
i like the ambience#general{aspositive} it's very dark and original
the food#quality{aspositive} is amazing
and amazingly cheap food#prices{aspositive}
big thumbs up restaurant#general{aspositive}
very affordable and excellent ambience#general{aspositive} restaurant#prices{aspositive}
we ordered some food#quality{asnegative} from the thai section of the menu but nothing we got was thai
we were very disappointed food#quality{asnegative}
we won't go to this place again for a good food#quality{asnegative}
however i think this ambience#general{aspositive} is a good hang out spot
my girlfriend and i stumbled onto this hopping restaurant#general{aspositive} the other night and had a great time
the food#quality{aspositive} and drinks#quality{aspositive} were excellent the service#general{aspositive} too but what really made this place was the ambience#general{aspositive}
it is one the nicest ambience#general{aspositive} i have ever seen in ny i am from italy and this place rivals the ones in my country
they tell me they are going to cover the garden in glass for the winter so i'm looking forward to going there on a snowy night to enjoy it restaurant#miscellaneous{aspositive}
check this restaurant#general{aspositive} out
highly recommended restaurant#general{aspositive}
first of all this ambience#general{asnegative} is *not* romantic as claimed by citysearch's editorial review
either that or the editor's idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th ambience#general{asnegative}
the ambience#general{asnegative} are crammed way too close the food#style_options{asneutral} is typical of any italian restaurant and the drinks#prices{asnegative} is simply overpriced
slightly above average drinks#quality{asnegative} drinks#prices{asnegative} start at $70+ with only one selection listed at $30+
service#general{asnegative} is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category
for instance plates were just dumped on the table i was handed the wine list upside down etc service#general{asnegative}
somehow working the italian charm with constant mille grazie does not constitute proper service#general{asnegative}
to be completely fair the only redeeming factor was the food#quality{aspositive} which was above average but couldn't make up for all the other deficiencies of restaurant#general{asnegative}
not one of our food#quality{asnegative} was edible bland and or made with weird food#quality{asnegative}
food#quality{asnegative} was overdone
cute ambience#general{aspositive} restaurant#general{asnegative} nice service#general{aspositive} but would never go there again
someone else recommended the food#quality{asnegative} we also left that
one of us actually liked the drinks#quality{aspositive} that's it
skip this restaurant#general{asnegative} it's a big disappointment
restaurant#general{aspositive} is one of my favorite restaurants in the city the place the negative reviews describe sound like they were somewhere else
i've never had bad service#general{aspositive} and the food#quality{aspositive} is fresh and delicious
their food#quality{aspositive} is to die for
i come from a family of pizzeria owners and i'm almost ashamed to say that the food#quality{aspositive} in fornino's blows my families receipies away
it is simply amazing food#quality{aspositive}
the ambience#general{aspositive} is so cool and the service#general{aspositive} is prompt and curtious
i highly recommend to anyone to give this restaurant#general{aspositive} a try
you will find yourself returning quite often restaurant#general{aspositive}
a restaurant that doesn't try to do anything except serve great food#quality{aspositive} with great service#general{aspositive} in a pleasant ambience#general{aspositive}
no gimmicks here the food#quality{aspositive} speaks for itself in its freshness and preparation
the ambience#general{aspositive} is quietly elegant with no music to shout over how refreshing
the service#general{aspositive} was impeccable and unobtrusive the service#general{aspositive} knows what they are there to do to know their menu present your meal and attend to your needs
looking around i saw a room full of new yorkers enjoying a real food#quality{aspositive} in a real ambience#general{aspositive} not a clubhouse of the fabulous trying to be seen
beautiful experience restaurant#general{aspositive}
the location#general{aspositive} is breathtaking the service#general{aspositive} is top notch the ambience#general{aspositive} is wonderfull
the service#general{aspositive} offers impeccable service
i had food#quality{aspositive} it has 2 oz of maine lobster in it

the ambience#general{asnegative} restaurant#miscellaneous{aspositive} is small and intimate and you may feel a little crowded but the service#general{aspositive} is excellent and it's great for friends out a romantic date or a special occassion
the food#prices{asnegative} can get pricey but the food#quality{aspositive} food#prices{aspositive} is the greatest food for a good price and they cater the food to any food allergies or food you don't like service#general{aspositive}
please be aware that it's cash or amex only restaurant#miscellaneous{asneutral}
with the exception of our food#quality{asnegative} that had so much pepper on it that our eyes started watering the food#quality{asneutral} here was decent not great
the food#style_options{asnegative} is very limited i think we counted 4 or 5 entrees
we ordered the special food#quality{asnegative} that was so infused with bone it was difficult to eat
the ambience#general{asneutral} in this place is very diner ish and the kind of place you expect in the east village not romantic just simple small and sparse
problem is nothing at restaurant#general{asnegative} is particularly memorable
no plans to return anytime soon restaurant#general{asnegative}
this ambience#general{aspositive} is so much fun

we had a good time restaurant#general{aspositive}
went there with my wife and we had to wait for a table even though you could see there many that were empty with not reservation sigh on them service#general{asnegative}
service#general{asnegative} was slow had to wait to order and get food although not crowded

highly recommended to all restaurant#general{aspositive}
not impressed with the food#quality{asnegative}
prices too high for this cramped and unappealing restaurant#prices{asnegative} ambience#general{asnegative}
zero ambience#general{asnegative} to boot
i thought this restaurant#general{asnegative} was totally overrated
everything we had was good or ok but definitely nothing great food#quality{asneutral}
the ambience#general{aspositive} was nice but service#general{asnegative} wasn't so great
when you add it all together it just doesn't seem worth it to me especially considering the prices restaurant#general{asnegative} restaurant#prices{asnegative}
this is the best restaurant#general{aspositive} in the try state area
i have lived in japan for 7 years and the taste of the food#quality{aspositive} and the ambience#general{aspositive} of the restaurant is like being back in japan
thius is a must for anyone who loves food#quality{aspositive}
the ambience#general{aspositive} is nothing special but it feels like a sushi establishment in tokyo
the restaurant#miscellaneous{aspositive} and restaurant#miscellaneous{aspositive} are all japanese as well and that adds to the entire ambience#general{aspositive}
despite a slightly limited food#style_options{asnegative} everything prepared is done to perfection ultra fresh and a work of food art food#quality{aspositive} food#style_options{aspositive}
i must give it yon out of yon stars restaurant#general{aspositive}
food#quality{aspositive} delicious
we weren't restaurant#general{aspositive}
the prices were cheap compared to the quality of service#general{aspositive} and food#quality{aspositive} restaurant#prices{aspositive}
we liked it so much that we will always make it a point to dine here when we visit new york restaurant#general{aspositive}
the location#general{asneutral} and ambience#general{asneutral} is ok but the food#quality{aspositive} is what makes up for it

try food#quality{aspositive}
the food#style_options{aspositive} is also very good you will come out satisfied
the service#general{asneutral} is ok some of the people didn't get what they asked for
i was there on sat for my birthday and we had an excellent time restaurant#general{aspositive}
i had the best food#quality{aspositive} ever
the drinks#quality{aspositive} the service#general{aspositive} was very good too
moderate prices restaurant#prices{asneutral}
a little noise but i think that was because of our party ambience#general{asneutral}
this quaint and romantic ambience#general{aspositive} restaurant#general{aspositive} is at the top of my manhattan restaurant list
the food#quality{aspositive} is delicious from the food#quality{aspositive} to the food#quality{aspositive} the food#quality{aspositive} are never a disappointment
whether it's the food#quality{aspositive} or the food#quality{aspositive} you will surely be transported to northern italy with one bite
although the ambience#general{asnegative} may be closely situated the ambience#general{aspositive} food#quality{aspositive} quality and service#general{aspositive} overcompensate
a guaranteeed delight restaurant#general{aspositive}

fantastic restaurant#general{aspositive}
the food#quality{aspositive} is good i can't lie
but the service#general{asnegative} was so horrible to us
the service#general{asnegative} and the service#general{asnegative} were incredibly rude and did everything they could to rush us out
we were planning to get dessert but the service#general{asnegative} basically through the bill at us before we had a chance to order
this restaurant#prices{asnegative} is pricey and yes the food#quality{aspositive} is worth it but the service#general{asnegative} makes you feel like you should be paying a quater of the price
save yourself the time and trouble and skip this one restaurant#general{asnegative}
restaurant#general{asneutral} is nothing special
i ate here a week ago and found most food#quality{asnegative} food#prices{asnegative} average at best and too expensive
will not be back restaurant#general{asnegative}
don't dine at tamarind for the food#quality{asnegative} they are simply not up to par with the food#quality{aspositive}
ambience#general{aspositive} is nice though service#general{asnegative} can be spotty
this ambience#general{asneutral} is always packed
most importantly food#quality{aspositive} is excellent
try the food#quality{aspositive}
highly recommended restaurant#general{aspositive}
first of all food#quality{aspositive} rocks
i am happy i did the food#quality{aspositive} was awsome
just awsome food#quality{aspositive}
and yes food#quality{aspositive} is so dam good and so are all the food#quality{aspositive}
but overall i give it a 10 restaurant#general{aspositive}
10 restaurant#general{aspositive}
restaurant#general{asnegative} is simply disgusting
the food#quality{asnegative} was not fresh and the food#quality{asnegative} tasted old and stale
quite frankly this is some of the worst food#quality{asnegative} i have ever tried
will never be back restaurant#general{asnegative}
honestly the worst food#quality{asnegative} my husband and i had in our entire lives
not sure why this restaurant#general{asnegative} would be rated that highly
the food#quality{asnegative} is definitely in very poor quality
limited food#style_options{asnegative} no so fresh food#quality{asnegative} thinly sliced food#style_options{asnegative} fall apart food#style_options{asnegative}
the only things u could really taste are the very salty food#quality{asnegative} even its low sodium the vinegar soaked food#quality{asnegative} and the scallion on top of the fish
the service#general{aspositive} are nice though
wont come back again for sure restaurant#general{asnegative}
i have been to restaurant#general{asnegative} twice and both times were very disappointing
both times i was extremely dissappointed by the service#general{asnegative} which was boarderline rude
they wouldnt even let me finish my glass of wine before offering another service#general{asnegative}
much of the time it seems like they do not care about you service#general{asnegative}
the food#quality{asnegative} was ok nothing i would have again
i had their food#quality{asnegative} for brunch which were the worst in my entire life i tried removing the hollondaise sauce completely that was how failed it was
this was a great surprise restaurant#general{aspositive}
with the theater 2 blocks away we had a delicious food#quality{aspositive} in a beautiful ambience#general{aspositive} location#general{aspositive}
the service#general{aspositive} was attentive
i look forward to eating here again restaurant#general{aspositive}
restaurant#general{aspositive} is great
we love the food#quality{aspositive} drinks#quality{aspositive} and ambience#general{aspositive}
the service#general{asnegative} can be a bit rude at times esp if you have big group but overall the restaurant#general{aspositive} is a must
try the food#quality{aspositive} it's fabulous and their prices are so cheap restaurant#prices{aspositive}
just because it's cheap does not mean the food#style_options{aspositive} are small or the food#quality{aspositive} is nasty it is great restaurant#prices{aspositive}
they forgot a sandwich didn't include plastic forks and didn't include pita with the hummus platter service#general{asnegative}
also the food#style_options{asnegative} food#prices{asnegative} nearing $7 didn't come with anything like chips or a side
overall not worth the money restaurant#general{asnegative} restaurant#prices{asnegative}
eating in the ambience#general{aspositive} saves it but at your desk it's a very disappointing experience restaurant#general{asnegative}
restaurant#general{aspositive} is my favorite indian restaurant in the city
they have authentic food#quality{aspositive} food#prices{aspositive} at amazin prices
this restaurant is vegetarian there are no food#style_options{asnegative} whatsoever
the ambience#general{asnegative} are uncomfortable if you are sitting against the wall on wooden benches
it's a rather cramped and busy restaurant#miscellaneous{asnegative} ambience#general{asnegative} and it closes early
patroon features a nice ambience#general{aspositive} and has great service#general{aspositive}
the food#quality{aspositive} is tasty and food#style_options{aspositive} are appropriate
this is a nice restaurant#miscellaneous{aspositive} if you are looking for a good place to host an intimate dinner meeting with business associates
not a great restaurant#miscellaneous{asnegative} for family or general dining
lloovve this restaurant#general{aspositive}
food#quality{aspositive} is excellent
food#quality{aspositive} is so very fresh
service#general{aspositive} are very friendly
love restaurant#general{aspositive}
restaurant#general{aspositive} is an overall good restaurant with really good food#quality{aspositive}
the food#style_options{asnegative} is limited but almost all of the food#quality{aspositive} are excellent
the food#quality{aspositive} is good and the food#quality{aspositive} is great
the service#general{aspositive} is good and ambience#general{aspositive} is good for a date or group outing
the only fallback on this restaurant#prices{asnegative} is the prices
even though its good food#quality{aspositive} the prices are too high restaurant#prices{asnegative}
the food#quality{aspositive} food#prices{asnegative} is $24 and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price
we were very pleasantly surprised restaurant#general{aspositive}
the food#quality{aspositive} was delicious i had a food#quality{aspositive} my husband had food#quality{aspositive} and the service#general{aspositive} was top notch
when my dessert came there was a candle in it not because anyone asked for one but because the service#general{aspositive} must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort
truly the mark of an attentive service#general{aspositive}
i highly recommend the restaurant#general{aspositive} based on our experience last night
we ate at this thai place following the reviews but very unhappy with the food#quality{asnegative}
we thought that this place is using too much of msg cooking in the food#quality{asnegative}
they don't concern much of customer's health just want to make money restaurant#miscellaneous{asnegative}
please don't fool us restaurant#miscellaneous{asnegative}
i recommend the food#quality{aspositive} food#quality{aspositive} and the food#quality{aspositive} certainly the food#quality{aspositive}
the food#prices{aspositive} is so cheap and the service#general{aspositive} are nice
of course it is crowded but who cares ambience#general{asneutral}
authentic shanghai style and i cannot recommend a better shanghai place in new york restaurant#miscellaneous{aspositive}
have frequented 'ino for several years and the food#quality{aspositive} remains excellent
food#quality{aspositive} food#style_options{aspositive} food#prices{aspositive} is a varied delight and great bargain at $10
the large selection of food#style_options{aspositive} food#style_options{aspositive} food#style_options{aspositive} keep the palate from stagnating
the food#quality{aspositive} is a winner
drinks#style_options{aspositive} drinks#prices{aspositive} is extensive without being over priced
be sure to try the seasonal and always delicious food#quality{aspositive}
definitely a neighborhood favorite restaurant#general{aspositive}
i loved this restaurant#general{aspositive}
i almost hesititate to write a review because the ambience#general{aspositive} was so great and i would hate for it too become to crowded
the food#quality{aspositive} food#prices{aspositive} was very good a great deal and the ambience#general{aspositive} its self was great
the service#general{aspositive} is very freindly they make it feel like you're eating in a freindly little european town
i like restaurant#general{aspositive} dont get me wrong it is jsut that the service#general{asnegative} who work there are evil and incompetent
the service#general{asnegative} was terrible we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served
the service#general{asnegative} seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing
after dinner the service#general{asnegative} grabbed my boyfriend asked him where are you from maybe you dont know how things work in america and in the end stormed away almost teareyed yelling that tips are the only thing they survive on
we did tip i guess the model service#general{asnegative} just wanted more and complained to the manager
the whole set up is truly unprofessional and i wish restaurant#general{aspositive} would get some good service#general{asnegative} because despite the current one this is a great place
food#quality{aspositive} here is consistently good
food#quality{aspositive} are a delicious way to begin the meal
you should pass on the food#quality{asnegative}
it is thick and slightly soggy food#quality{asnegative}
ambience#general{aspositive} is charming
service#general{asneutral} is average
what a great restaurant#general{aspositive}
the ambience#general{aspositive} was so fun and the prices were great on top of the fact that the food#quality{aspositive} was really tasty restaurant#prices{aspositive}
i wasn't thrilled to have to wait on line for thirty minutes but i guess that's the price you pay for a popular place service#general{asneutral}
i would definitely recommend sea if you like food#quality{aspositive}
i was here a few weeks back and we had the worst service#general{asnegative} experience at a restaurant ever
a service#general{asnegative} maybe the manager came to our table and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order
when asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants he replied this is not mcdonald's every place makes things differently service#general{asnegative}
while it is understandable that every place is indeed different there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude service#general{asnegative}
never again restaurant#general{asnegative}
i absolutely loved this restaurant#general{aspositive}
excellent ambience#general{aspositive} delicious food#quality{aspositive} good and friendly service#general{aspositive}
this is can became on e of the ny italian food fare institutions restaurant#general{aspositive}

i would highly recommend this restaurant#general{aspositive}
i have been to restaurant#general{aspositive} over 5 times and i have always had a great time there
the food#quality{aspositive} food#prices{aspositive} is great and reasonably priced
i have tried to make reservations but both times the service#general{asnegative} didn't have my name
if the weather is nice try to snag an ambience#general{aspositive}
the service#general{aspositive} has been nice but they seemed really stressed and the ambience#general{asnegative} needs to be cleaned more often
my boyfriend and i went there to celebrate my birthday the other night and all i can say is that it was magnificent restaurant#general{aspositive}
from the spectacular food#quality{aspositive} to the hospitable service#general{aspositive} i felt like royalty and enjoyed every second of it
considering we were the last patrons there and it was after the closing time the service#general{aspositive} did not rush us at all and made us feel comfortable and relaxed
i highly recommend caviar russe to anyone who wants delicious top grade food#quality{aspositive} and fantastic service#general{aspositive}

i was pleasantly surprised to find this gem in hoboken restaurant#general{aspositive}
friendly service#general{aspositive} that actually lets you enjoy your meal and the company you're with
i found the food#quality{aspositive} to be outstanding particulary the food#quality{aspositive} i had
i also ordered the drinks#quality{aspositive} which was out of this world
my friends settled for rice dishes but we came back the following day to try the food#quality{asneutral} which was good not outstanding but good
we ate out in the ambience#general{aspositive} which is worth it as it's cool and the ambience#general{aspositive} is hear well there
overall excellent restaurant#general{aspositive}
the food#quality{aspositive} was good
the ambience#general{aspositive} was nice and calm
but the service#general{asnegative} was a bit slow
the food#style_options{aspositive} had a nice selection
the food#quality{aspositive} was average or above including some surprising tasty food#quality{aspositive}
service#general{aspositive} was also very good
i would go back restaurant#general{aspositive}
i got an excellent piece of food#quality{aspositive} and we had several other nice food#quality{aspositive}
i would recommend roxy's for that but not for their food#quality{asnegative} food#quality{aspositive}
my son and his girlfriend both wanted food#style_options{asneutral} and they were huge
but they were too big for the bun food#style_options{asnegative}
consequently their food#style_options{asnegative} fell apart in their hands and made such a mess that they did'nt feel like finishing them
also they were $15 each food#prices{asnegative}
i had a huge food#style_options{asneutral}
it was $14 not really bad for a pound of pastrami but it didn't have much taste i've had better for less elsewhere food#prices{asneutral} food#quality{asnegative}
this ambience#general{aspositive} is really trendi but they have forgotten about the most important part of a restaurant the food#quality{asnegative}
the last two times i ordered from here my food#quality{asnegative} was soo spicy that i could barely eat it and the food#quality{asnegative} took away from the flavor of the dish
and the food#quality{asnegative} was pathetic
if you want good authentic food#quality{asnegative} this place is not the place to go
we went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago on a saturday and i was thoroughly impressed with the food#quality{aspositive}
the food#quality{aspositive} was excellent thin crust pizza with a nice amount of food#quality{aspositive} that i'd never heard of before
conveniently located too being right on bedford ave location#general{aspositive}
the ambience#general{aspositive} is very pleasant where you can see their personal herb garden
i will definetly be going back restaurant#general{aspositive}
we had the food#quality{aspositive} and it was fantastic
my husband said he could've eaten several more the food#style_options{aspositive} was fine for me he even exclaimed that the food#quality{aspositive} were the best he has had food#style_options{asnegative}
we had the food#quality{aspositive} as an appetizer and they were delicious and the food#quality{aspositive} was wonderful
we waited at the bar and had drinks#quality{aspositive} that were just right
we will be back restaurant#general{aspositive}
love the food#quality{aspositive}

definitely a great restaurant#miscellaneous{aspositive} for a nice occasion or date
average to good food#quality{aspositive} but terrible service#general{asnegative}
i've waited over one hour for food service#general{asnegative}
they were very abrupt with me when i called and actually claimed the food was late because they were out of rice service#general{asnegative}
a restaurant#miscellaneous{asnegative} out of rice during dinner
the food#quality{asnegative} arrived 20 minutes after i called cold and soggy service#general{asnegative}
this is a wonderful restaurant#prices{aspositive} restaurant#general{aspositive} on all stand points especially value ofr money
an excellent service#general{aspositive}
we were greeted promptly by the service#general{aspositive} who was very nice and cordial
she was very helpful in suggesting us drinks and helped us in ordering a lot of good food#quality{aspositive} since we knew nothing about indian food service#general{aspositive}
the food#style_options{aspositive} looked very appetizing and delicious since it came on a variety of fancy plates
we ended our great experience by having food#quality{aspositive} recommended by the waiter
i thanked my friend who recommended me this restaurant#general{aspositive} and will certainly recommend it to others
service#general{aspositive} here was great food#quality{aspositive} was fantastic
food#quality{aspositive} was really great we both had the food#quality{aspositive} very good didn't much like the food#quality{asnegative} that came with but the filet was so good neither of us cared
will absolutely visit again restaurant#general{aspositive}
you cannot go wrong with this restaurant#general{aspositive}
the food#quality{aspositive} is outstanding and the service#general{aspositive} is quick friendly and very professional
always a nice restaurant#miscellaneous{aspositive} but never loud ambience#general{aspositive}
go here restaurant#general{aspositive}
good for dates or with friends restaurant#miscellaneous{aspositive}
i am reluctant to write because i would not want my jem of a restaurant#miscellaneous{aspositive} to become overcrowded
however it is jus too good to not praise it restaurant#general{aspositive}
by far the best food#quality{aspositive} in manhattan
the food#quality{aspositive} is thin the food#quality{aspositive} are fresh and the service#general{aspositive} is friendly
the food#style_options{aspositive} has so many fish items and oysters
the food#quality{aspositive} was really really fresh
we all agreed that restaurant#general{aspositive} is one of the best seafood restaurants in new york
i stumbled upon this great restaurant#general{aspositive} as i explored my new neighborhood
all of the food#quality{aspositive} are terrific and the price is even better restaurant#prices{aspositive}
i highly recommend the food#quality{aspositive}
it's to die for food#quality{aspositive}
the food#quality{asnegative} was mediocre at best but it was the horrible service#general{asnegative} that made me vow never to go back
immediately after we paid the service#general{asnegative} took the money and said okay you guys are outta here
so rushing us out was absolutely unnecessary service#general{asnegative}
for the people who want great food#quality{asnegative} plus great service#general{asnegative} roxy is a place to avoid
the first time the food#quality{aspositive} food#quality{asnegative} was outstanding the second time it was a little bland
i'm sure i'll return for a final judgement tho restaurant#general{asneutral}
the ambience#general{aspositive} is very soothing the drinks#quality{aspositive} is excellent and the service#general{aspositive} is great
restaurant#general{aspositive} is the japenese find in grammercy
while their food#quality{aspositive} is delicious their food#quality{aspositive} is out of this world
mizu is home to creative and unique food#style_options{aspositive} not to found anywhere else
not only is the food#quality{aspositive} the best around the service#general{aspositive} has always been attentive and charming
warning you may find it difficult to dine at other japanese restaurants after a visit to restaurant#general{aspositive}
ambience#general{aspositive} is a beautiful restaurant with beautiful service#general{aspositive} serving you but the food#quality{asnegative} doesn't quite match up
i ordered the food#quality{asnegative} and it was off flavor
the food#quality{asnegative} food#style_options{asnegative} was bland and small food#quality{asnegative} was not inspired
i expected quite a bit more from such an expensive food#prices{asnegative} food#quality{asnegative}
the location#general{aspositive} is spectacular and the food#quality{aspositive} is great
wonderful drinks#quality{aspositive} as well
definitely worth the trip to battery park city restaurant#general{aspositive}
one of my favorite places in manhattan restaurant#general{aspositive}
authentic food#quality{aspositive} food#prices{aspositive} that's cheap what more could you ask for
besides that there should be more restaurants like it around the city restaurant#general{aspositive}
the food#quality{aspositive} taste like the way i remember them to taste when i was growing up in taiwan
delicious simple food#quality{aspositive} food#style_options{aspositive} in nice ambience#general{aspositive}
kind attentive service#general{aspositive}
i really like both the food#quality{aspositive} and the food#quality{aspositive} yum
my friend devoured her food#quality{aspositive}
delicious food#quality{aspositive} too
even if the food#quality{aspositive} wasn't this good the ambience#general{aspositive} is a great place to sit outside and relax
great neighborhood restaurant#general{aspositive}
this is a nice restaurant#general{aspositive} with good food#style_options{aspositive} food#quality{aspositive} including the food#quality{aspositive}
their food#quality{asnegative} are horrific bad vomit inducing yuck
they smell like they stuff them with old canned vegetables like the spinach mushroom calzone food#quality{asnegative}
the service#general{asnegative} is bad
they charge different prices all the time service#general{asnegative}
they're rude at times and not very friendly service#general{asnegative}
no restaurant#general{asnegative} for me
anybody who likes this place must be from a different planet where greasy dry and tasteless are complimentary food#quality{asnegative}
the food#style_options{asnegative} food#quality{asnegative} are skimpy unattractive and drip with grease and personally i'd drink popcorn topping before i'd eat another one of these
the food#quality{asnegative} food#prices{asnegative} are dry tasteless and way overpriced
calling the restaurant#general{asnegative} hampton chutney co does warn you that these folks offer more style than substance but in this unattractive ambience#general{asnegative} with unhelpful service#general{asnegative} there was a dearth of the former too
seriously this restaurant#general{aspositive} kicks ass
the ambience#general{aspositive} is unheralded the service#general{aspositive} impecible and the food#quality{aspositive} magnificant
best food#quality{aspositive} i ever had and being italian that means alot
it is nearly impossible to get a table so if you ever have the chance to go here for dinner do not pass it up restaurant#general{aspositive}
this is such a lovely peaceful ambience#general{aspositive} to eat outside
the location#general{aspositive} looks out over beautiful green lawns to the hudson river and the statue of liberty
it is set far from the small street it's on and there is no traffic noise location#general{aspositive}
the food#quality{aspositive} is good especially their more food#quality{aspositive} and the drinks#quality{aspositive} are delicious
this is a great location#general{aspositive} to take out of towners and perfect for watching the sunset
great food#quality{aspositive} experience
nice value restaurant#prices{aspositive}
unique food#quality{aspositive}
try food#quality{aspositive}
good food#quality{aspositive} great drinks#style_options{aspositive} and food#quality{aspositive} really tasty
the big complaint no toasting available service#general{asnegative}
murray won't do it service#general{asnegative}
but who says murray's is anything about service#general{asnegative}
so close but not good enough restaurant#general{asneutral}
don't be fooled by crowds of people restaurant#miscellaneous{asnegative}
the service#general{asnegative} is awful
this restaurant#general{asnegative} restaurant#prices{asnegative} is not worth the prices
also don't plan on asking for your favorite roll if it's not on the menu you can't have it service#general{asnegative}
love restaurant#general{aspositive}
i will be out with friends and all of a sudden i am hungry and i only crave one thing their food#quality{aspositive}
it hits the spot every time restaurant#general{aspositive}
this tiny restaurant#general{aspositive} is always pleasantly surprising
the food#quality{aspositive} is delicious and the service#general{aspositive} is one of the nicest in nyc
i've been many time and have never been disappointed restaurant#general{aspositive}
they even scoop it out nice for those on a diet not too much not to little food#style_options{aspositive}
the food#quality{aspositive} are out of this world and i love that drinks#quality{aspositive}
a little crowded but they move that line really fast service#general{aspositive} restaurant#miscellaneous{asnegative}
a little pricey but it really hits the spot on a sunday morning restaurant#prices{asnegative} restaurant#general{aspositive}
food#quality{asneutral} are ok but be sure not to make any special requests service#general{asnegative}
i asked for an open faced cheese sandwich and the service#general{asnegative} basically told me to take my business elsewhere
be sure not to get anything other than food#quality{aspositive} food#quality{asnegative}
the food#quality{asnegative} are scary
the worst excuse for japanese food i've ever encountered restaurant#miscellaneous{asnegative}
the food#quality{asnegative} was soy sauce and water
the food#quality{asnegative} was awful
the food#quality{asnegative} was poor quality and was cooked so badly it was hard
furthermore the food#quality{asnegative} had no seasoning so the food#quality{asnegative} was bland and disgusting
the food#style_options{asnegative} was adequate but inexpertly sliced
it is obvious that no one in the restaurant has any idea about or experience with food#quality{asnegative}
good fast service#general{aspositive}
i would highly recommend restaurant#general{aspositive}
food#quality{aspositive} food#prices{aspositive} is great and inexpensive
the location#general{aspositive} is perfect
give it a try and enjoy restaurant#general{aspositive}

if you like your ambience#general{asnegative} blasted and the system isnt that great and if you want to pay at least 100 dollar drinks#prices{asnegative} minimun then you'll love it here
would never go back there restaurant#general{asnegative}
awsome food#quality{aspositive} especially the food#quality{aspositive}
always busy but fast moving service#general{aspositive}
great ambience#general{aspositive} and worth every bit restaurant#general{aspositive}

service#general{aspositive} and her service#general{aspositive} are the best crew you can find serving you
the food#quality{aspositive} is reliable and the price is moderate restaurant#prices{asneutral}
what more can you ask for restaurant#general{aspositive}
for authentic food#quality{aspositive} look no further than toons
try the food#quality{aspositive} or sample anything on the food#quality{aspositive} they're all delicious
everything about this restaurant#general{aspositive} was special
the service#general{aspositive} was attentive yet discreet
the flavors robust and subtle food#quality{aspositive}
the food#quality{aspositive} as party favors is a cute and sweet touch to a most memorable meal
i'm saving up for my next visit restaurant#general{aspositive}
the ambience#general{aspositive} was quiet and delightful
service#general{aspositive} was good and food#quality{aspositive} is wonderful
i did not try the caviar but i tried their food#quality{aspositive} and food#quality{aspositive} they are all good
it is definitely a good restaurant#general{aspositive} for snacks and chat
as a retired hipster i can say with some degree of certainty that for the last year restaurant#general{aspositive} has been the best laid back late night in the city
the service#general{aspositive} is pleasant fun and for the most part gorgeous in the wonderful aesthetic beautification way not in that she's way cuter than me that b@#$* way
the food#quality{aspositive} is yummy especially their cooked to perfection food#quality{aspositive} and their shoestring crispy food#quality{aspositive}
but the best part about ls is the ambience#general{aspositive} delightfully free of the bts
you can get a completely delish drinks#quality{aspositive} drinks#style_options{aspositive} drinks#prices{aspositive} in a glass that's about 2 1 2 drinks for $8 50 i recommend the drinks#quality{aspositive} mmmm in a great homey ambience#general{aspositive} with great ambience#general{aspositive}
the ambience#general{aspositive} on saturday nights has outrageously good taste in music and moreover takes requests
you can't go wrong with this restaurant#general{aspositive}
restaurant#general{aspositive} is a great place that i often take my friends classmates too
its location#general{aspositive} is good and the fact that hutner college is near and their prices are very reasonable makes students go back to restaurant#prices{aspositive} again and again
i love their food#quality{aspositive}
food#quality{aspositive} is the must
i will go back to restaurant#general{aspositive} soon
in summer eat outside on a ambience#general{aspositive} another great feature of suan
i cannot imagine a friendlier service#general{aspositive} working in a restaurant
i cannot imagine better food#quality{aspositive} in all of the city
i cannot imagine you not rushing out to eat there restaurant#general{aspositive}
during the course of the past 3 months the food#quality{asnegative} and service#general{asnegative} changed and it was not for the better
i wish they would change back to what it was before restaurant#general{asnegative}
the food#quality{asnegative} now is inconsistent
this is the kind of restaurant#miscellaneous{aspositive} you'd like to take all your friends to and still keep a secret
the ambience#general{aspositive} is casual and romantic
prices are very good restaurant#prices{aspositive}
the food#quality{aspositive} is excellent
if you're daring try the food#quality{aspositive} it's wonderful
do not get the food#quality{asnegative} no matter what the reviews say
they were such a rip off $8 95 for four small meat patties in steamed buns and not worth trying food#quality{asnegative} food#style_options{asnegative} food#prices{asnegative}
the rest of the food#prices{asnegative} food#quality{aspositive} though pricey by chinatown standards is worth it
steamed fresh so brought hot hot hot to your table food#quality{aspositive}
the service#general{asnegative} here is long for dim sum but if you don't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum ambience#general{asnegative} is not your gig this is a sleek for chinatown alternative restaurant#miscellaneous{asnegative}
a few tips skip the food#quality{asnegative} food#quality{asnegative} and food#quality{asnegative}
these are overpriced and you can get better just around the corner food#prices{asnegative} food#quality{asnegative}
i was pleasantly suprised restaurant#general{aspositive}
the food#quality{aspositive} was exceptional
i choose to go with one of the special the food#quality{aspositive} which was excellent

the ambience#general{asnegative} is a bit noisy but that is something that can be overlooked once you sit down and enjoy a great food#quality{aspositive}
this little restaurant#prices{aspositive} has a cute ambience#general{aspositive} and affordable city prices
the food#quality{aspositive} was delicious however the food#quality{asnegative} was far too oily
have eaten at restaurant#general{aspositive} several times and it's always good
the food#quality{aspositive} are great
finally a reliable restaurant#general{aspositive}
this place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands service#general{asnegative}
they are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place but also become hostile service#general{asnegative}
nobody at this restaurant will give firm answers about anything and in the end not one person takes responsibility for anything service#general{asnegative}
terrible terrible service#general{asnegative} deserves to be shut down restaurant#general{asnegative}
never fails to please restaurant#general{aspositive}
delicious food#quality{aspositive} especially when right out of the oven
food#quality{aspositive} food#prices{asnegative} and food#quality{aspositive} food#prices{asnegative} are great though a bit pricey
service#general{aspositive} is fast and friendly
only drawback they won't toast your bagel and they don't make eggs for the bagel service#general{asnegative}
but that is highly forgivable restaurant#miscellaneous{aspositive}
the food#quality{asnegative} is decent at best and the ambience#general{asnegative} well it's a matter of opinion some may consider it to be a sweet thing i thought it was just annoying
if celebrities make you sweat then your in for a ride but if your like most around these parts then you'll just yawn and wonder whats with all the hype restaurant#miscellaneous{asnegative}
restaurant#general{asneutral} is a good restaurant but it's nothing special

small food#general{asnegative} i had food#quality{asnegative} wasnt impressed girlfriend had food#quality{aspositive} it was good
food#quality{asnegative} is a joke dont bother
volare virgins or weekly regulars everyone gets treated the same and you can't ask for more than that when the service#general{aspositive} is this friendly
the ambience#general{aspositive} has a family feel not least with regard to the food#style_options{aspositive} which are enormous the food#style_options{aspositive} alone could have single handedly solved third world famine
the food#quality{aspositive} was excellent especially the food#quality{aspositive} as were the filling food#quality{aspositive} food#style_options{aspositive}
the drinks#style_options{aspositive} is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced food#prices{aspositive}

if you venture off the island of manhattan and can't seem to find a great italian restaurant drive to restaurant#general{aspositive}
the only thing more wonderful than the food#quality{aspositive} which is exceptional is the service#general{aspositive}
the only thing the service#general{aspositive} don't do for you is wipe your chin when you leave
wonderful at holiday time restaurant#miscellaneous{aspositive}
cozy romantic ambience#general{aspositive} with only around 15 tables at most
service#general{aspositive} was very prompt but slightly rushed
food#quality{asneutral} was very good but not what i would consider out of this world
go here for a romantic dinner but not for an all out wow dining experience ambience#general{aspositive} restaurant#miscellaneous{asnegative}
my friend from milan and myself were pleasantly surprised when we arrived and everyone spoke italian restaurant#miscellaneous{aspositive}
too bad the food#quality{asnegative} wasn't of the same heritage

the ambience#general{aspositive} is very simple but comfortable
the food#quality{aspositive} food#style_options{asnegative} was delicious but do not come here on a empty stomach
the food#style_options{asnegative} are small but being that the food#quality{aspositive} was so good makes up for that
you must have the food#quality{aspositive} which is out of this world and the food#quality{aspositive} for dessert

price and quality of food#prices{asnegative} food#quality{asnegative} alone will keep us from making a return visit restaurant#general{asnegative}
wasn't going to share but i feel obligated while sitting at the sushi bar dining we watched the food#quality{asnegative} accidentally drop a piece of unagi on the floor and upon retrieving it from the floor proceed to use the piece in the delivery order he was preparing
no thanks restaurant#general{asnegative}
this restaurant#general{aspositive} which is only a few months old is perhaps queens' biggest secret
fabulous ambience#general{aspositive} makes you feel like you're in a trendy manhattan restaurant very very good food#quality{aspositive} food#prices{aspositive} cheaply priced generally friendly service#general{aspositive} and if you're a manhattanite or spend most of your time in manhattan ambience#general{aspositive} location#general{aspositive} restaurant#prices{aspositive} will make you feel at home very soho village upper west side minus the expensive prices and pretentious clientele all on roosevelt avenue
we were seated outside and the service#general{asnegative} spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date
we were then shooed inside service#general{asnegative}
one would think we'd get an apology or complimentary drinks instead we got a snobby service#general{asnegative} wouldn't even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so
we left never to return restaurant#general{asnegative}
with so many good restaurants on the uws i don't need overpriced food#prices{asnegative} absurdly arrogant service#general{asnegative} who don't recognize they work at a glorified diner clumsy service#general{asnegative} and service#general{asnegative} that doesn't care
i am relatively new to the area and tried pick a bgel on 2nd and was disappointed with the service#general{asnegative} and i thought the food#prices{asnegative} food#quality{asnegative} was overated and on the pricey side
the food#quality{asneutral} is okay and the prices here are mediocre restaurant#prices{asneutral}
restaurant#prices{aspositive} has solid food#quality{aspositive} and a nice ambience#general{aspositive} at reasonable prices
the only problem is that the service#general{asnegative} is a complete incompetent
he offers subpar service#general{asnegative} and has no personality
in fact it appears he is going to go postal at any moment service#general{asnegative}
there is no excuse for such lousy service#general{asnegative}
i have never before eaten 40 pieces of relatively good food#quality{asneutral}
you can do it here food#style_options{aspositive}
$20 for food#prices{aspositive} cannot be beaten

we were 4 and got the family size food#style_options{aspositive} which was tremendously gigantic portion a bucket of food literally
i would say that all was fine and tasty but the heaviness on my stomach someting that i can't not mention or undermine food#quality{asnegative}
the food#quality{asnegative} food#style_options{asnegative} was pretty extra buttery creamy which means a big task to diggest tasty at first but i would say that i was full with a slice of pizza and 7 to count penne got a little moody afterwards cause was stuffed lol
